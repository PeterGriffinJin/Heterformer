The Post-American Presidency: The Obama Administration's War on AmericaPopular conservative blogger Pamela Geller and New York Times bestselling author Robert Spencer sound a wake-up call for Americans to stop the Obama administration from limiting our hard-won freedoms, silencing our democratic voices, and irreparably harming America for generations to come. America is being tested in a way that she has never been tested before. Since taking the oath of office in January 2009, President Barack Obama has cheered our enemies and demoralized our allies. He is hard at work "remaking" America by destroying the free-market system and nationalizing major segments of our economy, demonizing dissent and restricting freedom of speech, turning against our longtime friends, and above all, subjecting us to the determinations of foreign authorities. In this timely and urgent battle cry, Pamela Geller, founder of the widely popular website www.AtlasShrugs.com, and New York Times bestselling author Robert Spencer team up to expose the Obama administration's destructive agenda--largely ignored by the mainstream media--and rally Americans to protect the sovereignty of a country that is under siege by the highest levels of its own government. As Americans see their paychecks shrinking every day, Obama ignores our forefathers' founding principle: individual rights. Instead, he seeks to level the playing field--to transform both the global and national landscape in favor of our enemies--even if it means cutting America off at the knees. He envisions himself as more than just a president of the United States, but as a shaper of the new world order, an internationalist energetically laying the groundwork for global government: the president of the world. A vital guide to helping conservatives prepare for the tough battles ahead, The Post-American Presidency critically examines the Obama administration's ominous and revealing moves against our basic freedoms, particularly as he seizes control of the three engines of the American economy: health care, energy, and education. The Shining City on a Hill has gone dark. But America is not dead. The time is NOW to stand up and fight.	Obama Zombies: How the Liberal Machine Brainwashed My Generation	Conservatives Without ConscienceDean's last NY Timesbestseller, Worse Than Watergate: The Secret Presidency of George W. Bush, offered the former White House insider's telling perspective on George W. Bush's presidency. Once again, he employs his knowledge & understanding of Washington politics & process to examine the conservative movement's current inner circle of radical Republican leaders--from Capitol Hill to Pennsylvania Ave to K Street & beyond. In Conservatives without Conscience, he not only highlights specific right-wing-driven GOP policies but also probes the conservative mindset, identifying recurring qualities such as the unbridled viciousness toward those daring to disagree with them, as well as the big business favoritism that costs taxpayers billions. He identifies specific examples of how court-packing seeks to form a judiciary that is biased by its very nature, how religious piety is producing politics run amok & how concealed indifference to the founding principles of liberty & equality is pushing America further & further from its constitutional foundations. By the end, he paints a vivid picture of what's happening at the top levels of the Republican Party, a party corrupted by leaders who cloak their actions in moral superiority while packaging their programs in blatant propaganda. He finds disturbing signs that current right-wing authoritarian thinking, when conflated with the domineering personalities of the conservative leadership, could take the USA toward its own version of fascism.	American-Made: The Enduring Legacy of the WPA: When FDR Put the Nation to WorkIf you've traveled the nation's highways, flown into New York's LaGuardia Airport, strolled San Antonio's River Walk, or seen the Pacific Ocean from the Beach Chalet in San Francisco, you have experienced some part of the legacy of the Works Progress Administration (WPA)--one of the enduring cornerstones of Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal. When President Roosevelt took the oath of office in March 1933, he was facing a devastated nation. Four years into the Great Depression, a staggering 13 million American workers were jobless and many millions more of their family members were equally in need. Desperation ruled the land. What people wanted were jobs, not handouts: the pride of earning a paycheck; and in 1935, after a variety of temporary relief measures, a permanent nationwide jobs program was created. This was the Works Progress Administration, and it would forever change the physical landscape and the social policies of the United States. The WPA lasted for eight years, spent $11 billion, employed 81/2 million men and women, and gave the country not only a renewed spirit but a fresh face. Under its colorful head, Harry Hopkins, the agency's remarkable accomplishment was to combine the urgency of putting people back to work with its vision of physically rebuilding America. Its workers laid roads, erected dams, bridges, tunnels, and airports. They stocked rivers, made toys, sewed clothes, served millions of hot school lunches. When disasters struck, they were there by the thousands to rescue the stranded. And all across the country the WPA's arts programs performed concerts, staged plays, painted murals, delighted children with circuses, created invaluable guidebooks. Even today, more than sixty years after the WPA ceased to exist, there is almost no area in America that does not bear some visible mark of its presence. Politically controversial, the WPA was staffed by passionate believers and hated by conservatives; its critics called its projects make-work and wags said it stood for We Piddle Around. The contrary was true. We have only to look about us today to discover its lasting presence. From the Hardcover edition.

Watch a Video	Tears of a Clown: Glenn Beck and the Tea Bagging of AmericaWashington Post columnist Dana Milbank takes a fair and balanced look at the unsettling rise of the silly Fox News host Glenn Beck.  Thomas Jefferson famously wrote that "the tree of Liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants. It is its natural manure." In America in 2010, Glenn Beck provides the very refreshment Jefferson had in mind: Whether he's the patriot or the tyrant, he's definitely full of manure. The wildly popular Fox News host with three million daily viewers perfectly captures the vitriol of our time and the fact-free state of our political culture. The secret to his success is his willingness to traffic in the fringe conspiracies and Internet hearsay that others wouldn't touch with a ten-foot pole: death panels, government health insurance for dogs, FEMA concentration camps, an Obama security force like Hitler's SS. But Beck, who is, according to a recent Gallup poll, admired by more Americans than the Pope, has nothing in his background that identifies him as an ideologue, giving rise to the speculation that his right-wing shtick is just that--the act of a brilliant showman, known for both his over-the-top daily outrages and for weeping on the air. Milbank describes, with lacerating wit, just how the former shock jock without a college degree has managed to become the most recognizable leader of antigovernment conservatives and exposes him as the guy who is single-handedly giving patriotism a bad name.	3601	1027	1560	5892	4965	187161	33071	25752	-1	83\$\$Pinheads and Patriots: Where You Stand in the Age of ObamaTelevision host, razor sharp political pundit, and #1 bestselling author Bill O'Reilly focuses in on where we all stand in the Age of Obama in Pinheads and Patriots.In this brave, hard-hitting, provocative volume, the author of Culture Warriorand A Bold, Fresh Piece of Humanityguides Americans through the extensive transformations sweeping their country and explains exactly what these profound changes mean for every one of us.	The Obama DiariesOn May 20, 2010, Laura Ingraham received a package from an anonymous source that will change the history of the United States and the legacy of President Barack Obama. While retrieving her automobile from the underground garage at the Watergate complex (where she had just enjoyed her weekly pedicure), Ingraham discovered a manila envelope on the hood of her car. When she picked it up, a deep baritone voice called out from a nearby stairwell: "Just read it. You'll know what to do." The shadowy figure then disappeared into the darkness without another word. The envelope contained copies of what appeared to be diary entries written by President Barack Obama, his family, and high-ranking administration officials. Because the "diaries" are so revealing, Ingraham felt compelled to release them to the American public and the citizens of the world. Major media outlets love to describe the president as "no drama Obama," but The Obama Diaries tells a different tale. Through these "diary entries," readers will see past the carefully constructed Obama facade to the administration's true plans to "remake America." In The Obama Diaries, Ingraham hilariously skewers the president and his minions. She takes aim at: *the cynical "razzle-dazzle" marketing of Obama's radical agenda *the use of the Obama "brand" and family to obscure Obama's true aims *Michelle Obama's gardening and anti-obesity initiative; and much more. Informative and hugely entertaining, The Obama Diaries will inspire both laughter and critical thinking about the future of the nation and the man currently at the helm.

Broke : The Plan to Restore our Trust, Truth and TreasureTHE FACTS. THE FUTURE. THE FIGHT TO FIX AMERICA--BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE. In the words of Harvard historian Niall Ferguson, the United States is "an empire on the edge of chaos." Why? Glenn Beck thinks the answer is pretty simple: Because we've turned our backs on the Constitution. Yes, our country is financially broke, but that's just a side effect of our broken spirit, our broken faith in government, the broken promises by our leaders, and a broken political system that has centralized power at the expense of individual rights. There is a lot of work ahead, but we can't move forward until we first understand how we got here. Starting with the American Revolution, Glenn takes readers on an express train through 234 years of history, culminating with the Great Recession and the bipartisan recklessness of Presidents Bush and Obama. It's the history lesson we all wished we'd had in school. (Did you know, for example, that FDR once made a key New Deal policy decision based on his lucky number?) Along the way, you'll see how everything you thought you knew about the political parties is a lie, how Democrats and Republicans alike used to fight for minimum government and maximum freedom, and how both parties have been taken over by a cancer called "progressivism." By the end, you'll understand why no president, no congress and no court can fix this problem alone. Looking toward them for answers is like looking toward the ocean for drinking water--it looks promising, but the end result is catastrophic. After revealing the trail of lies that brought us here, Broke exposes the truth about what we're really facing. Most people have seen pieces of the puzzle, but very few have ever seen the whole picture--and for very good reason: Our leaders have done everything in their power to hide it. If Americans understood how dire things really are, they would be demanding radical reform right now. Despite the rhetoric, that's not the kind of change our politicians really believe in. Finally, Brokeprovides the hope that comes with knowing the truth. Once you see what we're really up against, it's much easier to develop a realistic plan. To fix ourselves financially, Glenn argues, we have to fix ourselvesfirst. That means some serious introspection and, ultimately, a series of actions that will unite all Americans around the concept of shared sacrifice. After all, this generation may not be asked to storm beaches, but we are being asked to do something just as critical to preserving freedom. Packed with great stories from history, chalkboard-style teachable moments, custom illustrations, and Glenn Beck's trademark combination of entertainment and enlightenment, Broke makes the case that when you're traveling in the wrong direction, slight course corrections won't cut it--you need to take drastic action. Through a return to individual rights, an uncompromising adherence to the Constitution, and a complete rethinking about the role of government in a free society, Glenn exposes the idea of "transformation" for the progressive smokescreen that it is, and instead builds a compelling case that restoration is the only way forward.

Crisis and Command: A History of Executive Power from George Washington to George W. BushAn American President faces war and finds himself hamstrung by a Congress that will not act. To protect national security, he invokes his powers as Commander-in-Chief and orders actions that seem to violate laws enacted by Congress. He is excoriated for usurping dictatorial powers, placing himself above the law, and threatening to "breakdown constitutional safeguards." One could be forgiven for thinking that the above describes former President George W. Bush. Yet these particular attacks on presidential power were leveled against Franklin D. Roosevelt. They could just as well describe similar attacks leveled against George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Andrew Jackson, Abraham Lincoln and a number of other presidents challenged with leading the nation through times of national crisis.  However bitter, complex, and urgent today's controversies over executive power may be, John Yoo reminds us they are nothing new. In Crisis and Command, he explores a factor too little consulted in current debates: the past. Through shrewd and lucid analysis, he shows how the bold decisions made by Washington, Jefferson, Jackson, Lincoln, and FDR changed more than just history; they also transformed the role of the American president. The link between the vigorous exercise of executive power and presidential greatness, Yoo argues, is both significant and misunderstood. He makes the case that the founding fathers deliberately left the Constitution vague on the limits of presidential authority, drawing on history to demonstrate the benefi ts to the nation of a strong executive office.	3601	1027	1706	3363	1326	19746	-1	46932	-1	83

A Bargained-For BrideNovella "You're the sweetest girl in Mourning Dove Creek, you know?" Jack mumbled as he paused in kissing Jilly a moment. Jilly smiled. "And you're the handsomest man in Mourning Dove Creek, you know," she flirted in return. Jack smiled. "I do know," he said. Jilly giggled. Jack Taylor was so predictable--and a little conceited. He really did think he was the handsomest man in Mourning Dove--and he was, for the most part. Secretly, however, if Jilly ever allowed herself to be completely honest about it (which she tried to avoid), there was one other man in Mourning Dove who always crossed her mind when the subject of the handsomest man in town arose. Yet there was no lingering on thinking of that man--no sirree! Not for a moment! Not for any reason--ever. And so Jilly just kept telling Jack that he was the handsomest man in Mourning Dove Creek. Besides, it was almost true--being that the other man lived outside of town and not right in town the way Jack did.

You Can't Go Home AgainStory of an artist who flees scandal and despair as he journeys from his family home in a small Southern town to the capitals of prewar Europe.	Ship of FoolsThe story takes place in the summer of 1931, on board a cruise ship bound for Germany. Passengers include a Spanish noblewoman, a drunken German lawyer, an American divorcee, a pair of Mexican Catholic priests. This ship of fools is a crucible of intense experience, out of which everyone emerges forever changed. Rich in incident, passion, and treachery, the novel explores themes of nationalism, cultural and ethnic pride, and basic human frailty that are as relevant today as they were when the book was first published in 1962.	Let the Dead Bury Their DeadSet in North Carolina, these are stories about blacks and whites, young and old, rural and sophisticated, the real and fantastical. Named a New York Times Notable Book of the Year, nominated for the 1992 National Book Critics Circle Award, and given the Lambda Award.	Phthor	North Toward HomeWith his signature style and grace, Willie Morris, arguably one of this country's finest Southern writers, presents us with an unparalleled memoir of a country in transition and a boy coming of age in a period of tumultuous cultural, social, and political change. In North Toward Home, Morris vividly recalls the South of his childhood with all of its cruelty, grace, and foibles intact. He chronicles desegregation and the rise of Lyndon Johnson in Texas in the 50s and 60s, and New York in the 1960s, where he became the controversial editor of Harper'smagazine. North Toward Homeis the perceptive story of the education of an observant and intelligent young man, and a gifted writer's keen observations of a country in transition. It is, as Walker Percy wrote, "a touching, deeply felt and memorable account of one man's pilgrimage."

His previous novel, In the Rogue Blood, was awarded the Los Angeles Times Book Prize for Fiction. Now he has written a powerful and rousing historical saga of family loyalties, blood feuds, and betrayed friendships; of bank robberies and bootlegging; and of a passionate love as wild at heart as the Everglades. It is the story of sworn enemies: John Ashley, a criminal and folk hero, the brightest star in a family destined to become the most notorious in south Florida; and Bobby Baker, a lawman born of lawmen, a violent, hard-hearted man driven by the searing memory of past affronts and the enduring hatreds the engendered. Ashley and Maker will clash many times over many decades. And as the twentieth century encroaches on their world--and the wildlands give grudging way to the rising boomtown of Miami--a feral, sensual mating will place one man in gravest peril...while his adversary contrives a dark, personal vengeance that could leave countless lives--his own included--in ruin.	Eating Fire: Selected Poetry 1965-1995An omnibus edition of Margaret Atwood's poetry 1965 - 1995 including the latest collection Morning in the Burned House	Alcatraz: A History of the Penitentiary YearsALCATRAZ - the name alone said it all... It was meant to send a shudder down the spines of the nation's most incorrigible criminals. It stripped Al Capone of his power. It tamed "Machine Gun" Kelly into a model of decorum. It took the birds away from the Birdman of Alcatraz. When prisoners boarded the boat for Alcatraz, they knew that they had reached the end of the line. Not only was this the toughest of all Federal penitentiaries, but it was also said to be virtually escape-proof. The island was a natural fortress, separated from the mainland by a narrow strait of freezing water and deadly currents. This prison was the U.S. government's drastic answer to the lawlessness unleashed under Prohibition, which continued throughout the "Roaring Twenties" and into the teeth of the Great Depression. Alcatraz, with its damp cold and austere isolation, its rigid discipline and strict rule of silence, was as tough as the criminals that were sent there, and by the time the prison closed down in 1963, "the Rock" had indisputably done its job. Alcatraz - A History of the Penitentiary Years has sustained as a staple reference for staff members on Alcatraz and remains one of the most comprehensive references chronicling the history. This mammoth reference navigates the island's history through rarely seen documents, interviews and hundreds of pages of historic photographs. Author interviews range from men such as legendary FBI fugitive James "Whitey' Bulger; Dale Stamphill, a principle in the 1938 escape with Doc Barker and Henry Young; to Atom Spy Morton Sobell, the codefendant of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. Michael Esslinger thoroughly details the prominent events, inmates, and life inside the most infamous prison in American History. His research included hundreds of hours examining actual Alcatraz inmate case files (including rare original documents from Al Capone, Machine Gun Kelly, and over a hundred others) exploring the prison grounds from the rooftop to the waterfront to help retrace events, escape routes, in addition to conducting various interviews with former inmates & guards. Esslinger interviewed a variety of principle figures, comprised of both convicts and officers who were either involved, on-duty, or on Alcatraz during nearly escape attempt. Interviews included prisoners and officers that covered each era of operations at Alcatraz from the early military period in the late 1920's, through the federal years, 1934 to 1963. His study has resulted in detailed accounts of all the recorded escape attempts including the Battle of Alcatraz. A detailed account of the 1962 escape of Frank Morris and the Anglin Brothers provides rare insight extracted through photos, and over 1,700 pages of FBI and Bureau of Prisons investigative notes. Detailed narratives of Alcatraz's most notable inmates who include Robert Stroud (Birdman of Alcatraz), Al Capone, Machine Gun Kelly, Frank Morris, the Anglin Brothers, Doc Barker, Joe Cretzer, Bernard Coy, Miran Thompson, Sam Shockley, and many-many others. Alcatraz: The History of the Penitentiary Years, is a comprehensive reference on the history of Alcatraz and contains one of the most comprehensive archives of inmate and prison life photographs (over 1,000). WARNING: This book contains graphic depictions of extreme crime and violence and may not be suitable for all readers.

UndrawnKyle Reed stands on the verge of his lifelong dream of artistic immortality when a call from his estranged older brother Stuart puts a halt to everything in his carefully constructed life. Kyle faces the impossible decision to go back "home" and attempt to undo the many painful choices he made that severed his ties with his family and the woman he once loved. As he steps into the house he grew up in, Kyle revisits the lives he led. He walks through the elegant rooms where he learned to keep quiet to avoid his father's temper, and the debilitating disease that opened the doorway to his art. In his journey through his past, he assesses the perilous habits that distanced him from his family, the bitter enmities that still ravage his peace, and the surprising loyalty he finds in the people who surround him. Kyle juggles with the present and the past, he clings to sanity through his art, the passion that has become his true north. Between the sculptures and images that fill his spaces and canvases, lie the crucial aspects of his life that he's been avoiding for years: the icon he destroyed, the crime that still fills him with shame, and the forgiveness he never offered...or received.

Cien años de soledad"Muchos anos despues, frente al peloton de fusilamiento, el coronel Aureliano Buendia habia de recordar aquella tarde remota en que su padre lo llevo a conocer el hielo." Con estas palabras empieza una novela ya legendaria en los anales de la literatura universal, una de las aventuras literarias mas fascinantes de nuestro siglo. Cien anos de soledad es una novela del escritor colombiano y Premio Nobel de Literatura Gabriel Garcia Marquez. Considerada una obra maestra de la literatura hispanoamericana y universal, es una de las obras mas traducidas y leidas en espanol. El libro narra la historia de la familia Buendia a lo largo de siete generaciones en el pueblo ficticio de Macondo.	The Kingdom of This WorldA few years after its liberation from French colonialist rule, Haiti experienced a period of unsurpassed brutality, horror, and superstition under the reign of the black King Henri-Christophe. Through the eyes of the ancient slave Ti-Noel, The Kingdom of This Worldrecords the destruction of the black regime--built on the same corruption and contempt for human life that brought down the French--in an orgy of voodoo, race hatred, erotomania, and fantastic grandeurs of false elegance.	BestiarioIn these eight masterpieces there is no room for the smallest sign of stumbling or youthful undertones: they are perfect. These stories that speak about objects and daily happenings, pass over to another dimension, one of nightmare or revelation. In each text, surprise and uneasiness are ingredients added to the indescribable pleasure of its reading. These stories may upset readers due to a very rare characteristic in literature: They stare at us as if waiting for something in return. After reading these true classics, our opinion of the world cannot remain the same.	MemoirsPablo Neruda has been hailed as the greatest poet of the 20th century & was a Nobel laureat. In these memoirs he also recounts his distinguished career as a diplomat & politician, during which he came to know iconic figures including Gandhi, Che Guevara & Mao Tse Tung.	The Aleph and Other StoriesFull of philosophical puzzles and supernatural surprises, these stories contain some of Borges's most fully realized human characters. With uncanny insight he takes us inside the minds of an unrepentant Nazi, an imprisoned Mayan priest, fanatical Christian theologians, a woman plotting vengeance on her father's "killer," and a man awaiting his assassin in a Buenos Aires guest house. This volume also contains the hauntingly brief vignettes about literary imagination and personal identity collected in The Maker, which Borges wrote as failing eyesight and public fame began to undermine his sense of self.

The Stories of Eva LunaIsabel Allende is one of the world's most beloved authors. In 1988, she introduced the world to Eva Luna in a novel of the same name that recounted the adventurous life of a young Latin American woman whose powers as a storyteller bring her friendship and love. Returning to this tale, Allende presents The Stories of Eva Luna,a treasure trove of brilliantly crafted stories. Lying in bed with her European lover, refugee and journalist Rolf Carle, Eva answers hes request for a story "you have never told anyone before" with these twenty-three samples of her vibrant artistry. Interweaving the real and the magical, she explores love, vengeance, compassion, and the strenghts of women, creating a world that is at once poingnantly familiar and intriguingly new. Rendered in the sumptuously imagined, uniquely magical style of one of the world's most stunning writers, The Stories of Eva Luna is the conerstone of Allende's work. It is not to be missed by anyone -- whether a devotee of Ms. Allende's oeuvre or a new acquaintance to her work.	5770	3575	5433	5481	6534	17485	-1	-1	113	-1\$\$The PresidentGuatemalan diplomat and writer Miguel Angel Asturias (1899-1974) began this award-winning work while still a law student. It is a story of a ruthless dictator and his schemes to dispose of a political adversary in an unnamed Latin American country usually identified as Guatemala. The book has been acclaimed for portraying both a totalitarian government and its damaging psychological effects. Drawing from his experiences as a journalist writing under repressive conditions, Asturias employs such literary devices as satire to convey the government's transgressions and surrealistic dream sequences to demonstrate the police state's impact on the individual psyche. Asturias's stance against all forms of injustice in Guatemala caused critics to view the author as a compassionate spokesperson for the oppressed. My work," Asturias promised when he accepted the Nobel Prize for Literature, "will continue to reflect the voice of the people, gathering their myths and popular beliefs and at the same time seeking to give birth to a universal consciousness of Latin American problems."	A Brief LifeIn A Brief Life, Juan Carlos Onetti's protagonist, Brausen, is caring for his wife after a long illness. To compensate for the physical void which temporarily stalls their caresses, Brausen eavesdrops on the conversation of his neighbors, a husband and wife, imagining their gestures and their expressions. But he not only wishes to imagine himself as someone else, he also seeks release from the world he knows. He leads many lives, some real and some fantastic, in order to experience a moment of psychic weightlessness.	The Green HouseMario Vargas Llosa's classic early novel takes place in a Peruvian town, situated between desert and jungle, which is torn by boredom and lust. Don Anselmo, a stranger in a black coat, builds a brothel on the outskirts of the town while he charms its innocent people, setting in motion a chain reaction with extraordinary consequences.This brothel, called the Green House, brings together the innocent and the corrupt; Bonificia, a young Indian girl saved by the nuns only to become a prostitute; Father Garcia, struggling for the church; and four best friends drawn to both excitement and escape.The conflicting forces that haunt the Green House evoke a world balanced between savagery and civilization -- and one that is cursed by not being able to discern between the two.

Tiempo de silencioLa primera edicion de Tiempo de silencioaparecio en Biblioteca Formentor, Seix Barral, en 1961 y alcanzo casi inmediatamente una extraordinaria resonancia critica. Ha sido traducido al ingles, al frances, al italiano, al aleman, al holandes, al portugues, al sueco, al checo, al rumano, al finlandes, al danes y al polaco. Dondequiera ha sido senalada como una obra excepcional. Tiempo de silenciotranscurre en Madrid precisamente durante el otono de 1949. A partir de un accidente estupido y de sus consecuencias --no por evitables menos determinadas-- el autor nos muestra con ojo ironico el panorama complete de los estratos sociales de la ciudad. Lo mas significativo del libro, no obstante, es su decidido y revolucionario empeno por alcanzar una renovacion estilistica a partir --ya que no en contra-- del monocorde realismo de la novella espanola de la epoca en que aparecio. La presente edicion tiene character definitive, por cuanto en ella se han restituido al texto la plena totalidad de las supresiones que habia forzado a introducer en el la censura del anterior regimen espanol en sus diversas formas. Parte de tales supresiones habian sido ya subsanadas de modo paulatino en precedents ediciones; pero solo en la presente el lector tundra acceso a la integridad del texto tal como fue originariamente redactado por el novelista.

Na cestěNovy preklad romanu z roku 1957, ktery autorovi prinesl obrovskou popularitu i uznani kritiky a ucinil z nej legendu. Kerouac zde nachazi sve osudove tema i vlastni hlas a metodu: horecne chrleny text odrazi autenticitu svobodneho zivota, nesvazovaneho konvencemi prumernosti. Takovy zivot a lide, kteri jej dovedou zit, jsou pro nej idealem, jejz se neustale pokousi naplnit a zachytit v postavach svych knih. Na ceste je strhujici a presvedcivy amalgam fikce a autobiografickych prvku, dodnes inspirujici ctenare k nalezani vlastni svobodne cesty.	The MoviegoerWinner of the 1961 National Book Award The dazzling novel that established Walker Percy as one of the major voices in Southern literature is now available for the first time in Vintage paperback. The Moviegoeris Binx Bolling, a young New Orleans stockbroker who surveys the world with the detached gaze of a Bourbon Street dandy even as he yearns for a spiritual redemption he cannot bring himself to believe in. On the eve of his thirtieth birthday, he occupies himself dallying with his secretaries and going to movies, which provide him with the "treasurable moments" absent from his real life. But one fateful Mardi Gras, Binx embarks on a hare-brained quest that outrages his family, endangers his fragile cousin Kate, and sends him reeling through the chaos of New Orleans' French Quarter. Wry and wrenching, rich in irony and romance, The Moviegoeris a genuine American classic.	How's Your Drink?: Cocktails, Culture, and the Art of Drinking WellBased on the popular feature in the Saturday Wall Street Journal,How's Your Drinkilluminates the culture of the cocktail. Cocktails are back after decades of decline, but the literature and lore of the classics has been missing. John F. Kennedy played nuclear brinksmanship with a gin and tonic in his hand. Teddy Roosevelt took the witness stand to testify that six mint juleps over the course of his presidency did not make him a drunk. Ernest Hemingway and Raymond Chandler both did their part to promote the gimlet. Fighting men mixed drinks with whatever liquor could be scavenged between barrages, raising glasses to celebrate victory and to ease the pain of defeat. Eric Felten tells all of these stories and many more, and also offers exhaustively researched cocktail recipes. How's Your Drinkis an essential addition to the literature of spirits and a fantastic holiday gift for husbands and fathers.	Howl and Other PoemsThe prophetic poem that launched a generation when it was first published in 1956 is here presented in a commemorative fortieth Anniversary Edition. When the book arrived from its British printers, it was seized almost immediately by U.S. Customs, and shortly thereafter the San Francisco police arrested its publisher and editor, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, together with City Lights Bookstore manager Shigeyoshi Murao. The two of them were charged with disseminating obscene literature, and the case went to trial in the municipal court of Judge Clayton Horn. A parade of distinguished literary and academic witnesses persuaded the judge that the title poem was indeed not obscene and that it had "redeeming social significance." Thus was Howl & Other Poems freed to become the single most influential poetic work of the post-World War II era, with over 900,000 copies now in print."	Naked LunchNaked Lunch(sometimes The Naked Lunch) is a novel by William S. Burroughs originally published in 1959. The book is structured as a series of loosely connected vignettes. Burroughs stated that the chapters are intended to be read in any order. The reader follows the narration of junkie William Lee, who takes on various aliases, from the US to Mexico, eventually to Tangier and the dreamlike Interzone. The vignettes (which Burroughs called "routines") are drawn from Burroughs' own experience in these places, and his addiction to drugs (heroin, morphine, and while in Tangier, "Majoun"--a strong marijuana confection--as well as a German opioid, brand name Eukodol, of which he wrote frequently). The novel was included in Time magazine's "100 Best English-language Novels from 1923 to 2005". In 1991, David Cronenberg released a film of the same name based upon the novel and other Burroughs writings.	Tropic of CancerNow hailed as an American classic, Tropic of Cancer, Henry Miller's masterpiece, was banned as obscene in this country for twenty-seven years after its first publication in Paris in 1934. Only a historic court ruling that changed American censorship standards, ushering in a new era of freedom and frankness in modern literature, permitted the publication of this first volume of Miller's famed mixture of memoir and fiction, which chronicles with unapologetic gusto the bawdy adventures of a young expatriate writer, his friends, and the characters they meet in Paris in the 1930s. Tropic of Canceris now considered, as Norman Mailer said, "one of the ten or twenty great novels of our century."	5162	30	832	5481	192	5196	170051	14147	84	158\$\$First Third & Other Writings - Revised & Expanded Edition Together With A New PrologueImmortalized as Dean Moriarty by Jack Kerouac in his epic novel, On the Road, Neal Cassady was infamous for his unstoppable energy and his overwhelming charm, his savvy hustle and his devil-may-care attitude. A treasured friend and traveling companion of Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg, William Burroughs, and Ken Kesey, to name just some of his cohorts on the beatnik path, Cassady lived life to the fullest, ready for inspiration at any turn. Before he died in Mexico in 1968, just four days shy of his forty-second birthday, Cassady had written the jacket blurb for this book: "Seldom has there been a story of a man so balled up. No doubt many readers will not believe the veracity of the author, but I assure these doubting Thomases that every incident, as such, is true." As Ferlingetti writes in his editor's note, Cassady was "an early prototype of the urban cowboy who a hundred years ago might have been an outlaw on the range." Here are his autobiographical writings, the rambling American saga of a truly free individual.	Memory Babe: A Critical Biography of Jack KerouacIn 1969 Jack Kerouac died a premature death. While his legendary lifestyle and unique creative talent made him a hero in his lifetime, his literary influence has grown steadily since. With Memory Babe(a childhood nickname honoring Kerouac's feats of memory), Gerald Nicosia gives us a complete biography of Jack Kerouac--an honest, discriminating and, above all, compassionate assessment. This edition is enhanced by many rare photographs never before published.	Kerouac: A BiographyNow that Kerouac's major novel, On the Road is accepted as an American classic, academic critics are slowly beginning to catch up with his experimental literary methods and examine the dozen books comprising what he called 'the legend of Duluoz.' Nearly all of his books have been in print internationally since his death in 1969, and his writing has been discovered and enjoyed by new readers throughout the world. Kerouac's view of the promise of America, the seductive and lovely vision of the beckoning open spaces of our continent, has never been expressed better by subsequent writers, perhaps because Kerouac was our last writer to believe in America's promise--and essential innocence--as the legacy he would explore in his autobiographical fiction.	The Yage LettersAn early epistolary novel by William Burroughs, whose 1951 account of himself as as junkie, published under the pseudonym William Lee, ended Yage may be the final fix. In letters to Allen Ginsberg, an unknown young poet in New York, his journey to the Amazon jungle is recorded, detailing picaresque incidents of a search for a telepathic-hallucinogenic-mind-expanding drug called yage (Ayahuasca, or Banisteripsis Caape), used by Amazon indian doctors for finding lost objects, mostly bodies and souls. Author and recipient of these letters met again in New York, Christmas 1953, and edited the writings to form this single book. The correspondence contains the first seeds of the later Burroughsian fantasy in Naked Lunch. Seven years later Ginsberg in Peru writes his old guru an account of his own visions and terrors with the same drug, appealing for further counsel. Burroughs' mysterious reply is sent. The volume concludes with two epilogues: a short note from Ginsberg on his return from the Orient years later reassuring Self that he is still here on earth, and a final poetic cut-up by Burroughs, I am dying, Meester?	I Celebrate Myself: The Somewhat Private Life of Allen Ginsberg	Off the Road: My Years with Cassady, Kerouac, and GinsbergNeal Cassady was a living legend, his dauntless, wild spirit immortalized in the bible of the Beat generation, Jack Kerouac's "On the Road."In this vivid, comic, and wise account, Neal's wife captures the turbulene and raw excitement of her years with Cassady, with Kerouac(her sometime lover), and with Allen Ginsberg - an intense rival for Neal's affection. Reverberating with all the creative energy - and poetry - of a legendary time, "Off the Road" is the authentic story of the people who captured the imagination of America's youth and brought this country into the 1960s.	30	2896	5575	3405	192	65421	-1	-1	5	-1

MalpertuisAbbiamo sempre sospettato che dietro le piu antiche leggende si nasconda un frammento di verita: Malpertuis cela un segreto e il suo nome evoca il male sotto forma di quello che non dovrebbe piu camminare sulla terra. Nella casa dell'ignoto, all'apparenza un'antica e rispettabile dimora delle Fiandre, si intreccia la storia di un gruppo di personaggi che non sono quello che sembrano e che incarnano forze primigenie. Uno dei miti immemorabili dell'umanita sta prendendo forma e sembianze di nuovo... Presentato in edizione integrale, questo romanzo e il capolavoro di Jean Ray, lo scrittore che e stato definito l'erede europeo di H.P. Lovecraft.	Ghosts And RuinsWho doesn't love a good ghost story? This gorgeous, coffee-table art book is a compendium of old, forgotten haunted houses imagined by artist Ben Catmull, along with the stories and rumors of who haunts them, and why. Each spread features a different haunted house, lovingly and exquisitely rendered in scratchboard on masonite, with a short, nightmare-inducing description of each scene. In "Drowned Shelley," for example: A chorus of frogs surrounds the house where young Shelley was drowned headfirst in the bathtub by her drunken stepfather. Say her name 13 times while looking in the pond and she will drown you in your sleep. Say her name the wrong number of times while looking in the pond, and she will leave hair in your breakfast dishes. Say her name 13 times while not looking in the pond, and she will watch you when you clip your toenails. Mispronounce her name 13 times while looking anywhere near the pond, and she will kick you somewhere delicate at the stroke of midnight. Catmull's images are evocative, haunting masterpieces that never tread in graphic imagery, choosing instead to suggest horrors far more frightening than what they explicitly depict. With just the right touch of humor to balance the terror, Ghosts and Ruins is sure to attract fans of Edward Gorey or Tim Burton, and makes a perfect gift book for the ghost story fan in your house.	The Dark Domain	The Devil's Dictionary and Other WorksThe Devil's Dictionary, An Imperfect Conflagration, The Boarded Window,and Death- here are four of the best works by Ambrose Bierce, one of the most brilliant and incisive writers ever. This volume collects one example of each type of composition for which Bierce is most famed: a hilarious satire, a bone-chilling horror story, a sardonic piece of humor, and a macabre poem. Renowned artist Gahan Wilson, whose work finds the comic and the eerir in the most common of situations, brings the perfect, blackly humorous touch to Bierce's eccentrically unique visions.	The Decapitated Chicken and Other StoriesHoracio Quiroga's short stories are infused with the themes of life and death that so obsessed him. They span many fiction genres; jungle tale, Gothic horror story, psychological study, and morality tale- and possess a universality that has made him a classic Latin American writer. Horacio Quiroga was a master storyteller and author of over two hundred pieces of Latin American fiction that have been compared to the works of Poe, Kipling, and London. Like his stories, his own life from his birth in Uruguay to his suicide in Argentina was filled with adventure, tragedy, and violence.

A liar, a cheat, a degenerate, and a whore. These are the last people one might expect to be virtuous. But a legendary Kabbalist has discovered the truth: they are just some of the thirty-six hidden ones, the righteous individuals who ultimately make the world a better place. In these captivating stories, we meet twelve of the secret benefactors, including a timekeeper's son who shows a sleepless village the beauty of dreams; a gambler who teaches a king ruled by the tyranny of the past to roll the dice; a thief who realizes that his job is to keep his fellow townsfolk honest; and a golem-a woman made of mud-who teaches kings and peasants the real nature of humanity. With boundless imagination and a delightful sense of humor, acclaimed writer and artist Jonathon Keats has turned the traditional folktale on its head, creating heroes from the unlikeliest of characters, and enchanting readers with these stunningly original fables.	A Child AgainCasey returns to bat. The Pied Piper pipes again. Little Red Riding Hood is not safe yet. Robert Coover returns with a new collection of short fiction, reexamining our shared narrative heritage -- myths, fairy tales, and favorite childhood stories -- and unearthing the underlying hope, fear, and wonder at their core. Playful yet systematic, satirical yet empathetic, Coover uses the stories of our past to point towards a fiction of the future.	Imaginary LivesVidas imaginarias(1895) narra la "vida de algunos poetas, dioses, asesinos y piratas, asi como de varias princesas y damas galantes...". Pero no lo hace a la manera convencional de los biografos, que solo apreciaban la "vida publica o la gramatica", "las ideas de los grandes hombres" y aquellos puntos en que sus vidas "se unieron a las acciones generales", sino de una manera artistica. Ni las biografias ni la historia hablan de la individualidad de los hombres, solo dan fechas e ideas. Y lo que le interesa a Marcel Schwob es justamente aquello que esquiva toda generalizacion, lo azaroso, lo raro, las extravagancias humanas. El ejemplar prologo del propio autor expone esta diferencias y los motivos de su libro. "Los protagonistas son reales: los hechos pueden ser fabulosos y no pocas veces fantasticos. El sabor peculiar de este volumen esta en ese vaiven", escribio Borges, que nunca nego la influencia de estas Vidas imaginariasen su Historia universal de la infamia.	The Beetle LegThe Beetle Leg, John Hawkes's second full-length novel, was first published by New Directions in 1951. Now, after more than sixty years, this brilliant novel is emerging as a classic of visionary writing and still remains Hawkes's only work devoted solely to American life. As a "surrealist Western" (Newsweek), and a violent and poetic portrayal of "a landscape of sexual apathy" (A.J. Guerard), The Beetle Legis a rich flight into the special vein of comedy that Hawkes had begun to exploit a decade before the popular acceptance of "black humor."	WindeyeA woman falling out of sync with the world; a king's servant hypnotized by his murderous horse; a transplanted ear with a mind of its ownthe characters in these stories live as interlopers in a world shaped by mysterious disappearances and unfathomable discrepancies between the real and imagined. Brian Evenson, master of literary horror, presents his most far-ranging collection to date, exploring how humans can persist in an increasingly unreal world. Haunting, gripping, and psychologically fierce, these tales illuminate a dark and unsettling side of humanity.Praised by Peter Straub for going "furthest out on the sheerest, least sheltered narrative precipice," Brian Evensonis the author of ten books of fiction. He has been a finalist for the Edgar Award, the Shirley Jackson Award, and the World Fantasy Award, and the winner of the International Horror Guild Award, and the American Library Association's award for Best Horror Novel. Fugue Statewas named one of Time Out New York's Best Books of 2009. The recipient of a National Endowment for the Arts fellowship and three O. Henry Prizes, including one for the title story in "Windeye," Evenson lives in Providence, Rhode Island, where he directs Brown University's Literary Arts Department.	The Deep ZooIncluded in Library Journal's"25 Key Indie Fiction Titles, Fall 2014-Winter 2015" Within the writer's life, words and things acquire power. For Borges it is the tiger and the color red, for Cortazar a pair of amorous lions, and for an early Egyptian scribe the monarch butterfly that metamorphosed into the Key of Life. Ducornet names these powers The Deep Zoo. Her essays take us from the glorious bestiary of Aloys Zotl to Abu Ghraib, from the tree of life to Sade's Silling Castle, from The Epic of Gilgameshto virtual reality. Says Ducornet, "To write with the irresistible ink of tigers and the uncaging of our own Deep Zoo, we need to be attentive and fearless--above all very curious--and all at the same time." "Ducornet's skill at drawing unexpected connections, and her ability to move between outrage and meditativeness, are gripping to behold."--Star Tribune "This collection of essays meditates on art, mysticism, and more; it'll leave a reader with plenty to ponder."--Vol. 1 Brooklyn "Rikki Ducornet's new collection The Deep Zoo is filled with smart and surprising essays that explore our connections to the world through art."--Largehearted Boy ""The Deep Zoo" acts as a kind of foundational text, a lens to view her work and the other essays through. . . Subversive at heart and acutely perceptive."--Numero Cinq "Ducornet moves between these facets of human experience with otherworldly grace, creating surprising parallels and associations. . . The Deep Zoo is a testament to her acrobatic intelligence and unflinching curiosity. Ducornet not only trusts the subconscious, she celebrates and interrogates it."--The Heavy Feather "What struck me most about this collection, and what I am confident will pull me back to it again, is Ducornet's obvious passion for life. She is . . . attentive, fearless, and curious. And for a hundred pages we get to see how it feels to exist like that, what it's like to think critically and still be open to the world."--Cleaver Magazine "Rikki Ducornet is imagination's emissary to this mundane world."--Stephen Sparks, Green Apple Books on the Park "This book is like the secret at the heart of the world; I've put other books aside."--Anne Germanacos, author of Tribute Praise for Rikki Ducornet "A novelist whose vocabulary sweats with a kind of lyrical heat."--The New York Times "Linguistically explosive . . . one of the most interesting American writers around."--The Nation "Ducornet--surrealist, absurdist, pure anarchist at times--is one of our most accomplished writers, adept at seizing on the perfect details and writing with emotion and cool detachment simultaneously."--Jeff Vandermeer "A unique combination of the practical and fabulous, a woman equally alive to the possibilities of joy and the necessity of political responsibility, a creature--a la Shakespeare's Cleopatra--of 'infinite variety,' Ducornet is a writer of extraordinary power, in whose books 'rigor and imagination' (her watchwords) perform with the grace and daring of high-wire acrobats."--Laura Mullen, BOMB Magazine "The perversity, decadence, and even the depravity that Ducornet renders here feel explosively fresh because their sources are thought and emotion, not the body, and finally there's some pathos too."-- The Boston Globe "Ducornet's skill at drawing unexpected connections, and her ability to move between outrage and meditativeness, are gripping to behold."--Tobias Carroll, Star Tribune "This collection of essays meditates on art, mysticism, and more; it'll leave a reader with plenty to ponder."-- Vol. 1 Brooklyn "Rikki Ducornet's new collection The Deep Zoo is filled with smart and surprising essays that explore our connections to the world through art."-- Largehearted Boy	2816	410	5745	3646	5770	53904	-1	3371	-1	274

He had a wide white smile that could make any girl melt, he had shaggy long blonde hair and innocent baby blue eyes. His Australian accent added to his worldly charm. He looked like a sweet and kind surfer but with a jaw gripped tight that showed anger. I looked down at the blade gripped in his palm and the blood dripping from the edges. His face read that of almost sorrow, but only almost. I looked at the floor, my voice lost in a scream. I looked down at her soft cheeks, her auburn hair and her still green eyes. She wasn't blinking, she wasn't breathing. I saw the crimson red spread from her cut throat all over the Italian marble floor. It seeped into the cracks. This girl, this fifteen year old girl with blood staining her favourite floral dress... She couldn't be my sister, I wouldn't believe it. I foolishly thought this would be the worst day of my life. That was the day I was taken, that was the day I met Draco. Can be read as a standalone alternatively - part 1 of 3.	5158	3632	3313	3492	1759	152856	185574	-1	-1	48
Footsteps in the DarkWhat begins as an adventure soon becomes a nightmare... Locals claim it is haunted and refuse to put a single toe past the front door, but to siblings Peter, Celia, and Margaret, the Priory is nothing more than a rundown estate inherited from their late uncle-and the perfect setting for a much-needed holiday. But when a murder victim is discovered in the drafty Priory halls, the once unconcerned trio begins to fear that the ghostly rumors are true and they are not alone after all! With a killer on the loose, will they find themselves the next victims of a supernatural predator, or will they uncover a far more corporeal culprit?

Retirementology: Rethinking the American Dream in a New EconomyA superb introduction to the necessary financial planning no American over 40 can afford to ignore. "Publishers Weekly" "" It s time for many individual investors to make some hard choices. Baby Boomers are learning to deal with the fact that they really can t have it all--at least not all at once. "Retirementology "is a great guide to helping them think through their plans for living, saving, and spending. Marion Asnes, Editor in Chief, "Financial Planning " magazine "Retirementology "applies behavioral finance to retirement planning and finds we all could be doing a lot better when it comes to making decisions about retirement. But don t despair: Not only does Dr. Salsbury crisply describe our self-destructive financial behavior, he offers much more--namely, ways we can improve financial decisions. The book is a real contribution to both behavioral finance and the field of retirement planning. David Adler, author of "Snap Judgment" "Retirementology "is an entertaining, yet sobering, journey through the cognitive errors and social biases harming our current and future lifestyles. Dr. Salsbury s book is not just for retirees or those soon to retire--the earlier you read it, the better you can live! John Nofsinger, Ph.D., Associate Professor of Finance, Washington State University, and author of "The Psychology of Investing" "" Looking ahead to retirement? Depending on your circumstances and your age, you may no longer have any margin for error. And your emotions and irrational behavior could be perpetuating a dangerous cycle of overspending and rising debt that may shatter whatever vision of retirement you still have. Welcome to the world of "Retirementology." "Retirementology "bridges retirement planning with investor psychology and the market Meltdown of 2008 to produce an entirely new way of thinking about how we spend, how we save, how we borrow, and how we invest. Financial mistakes are deeply rooted in human nature, but you may be able to overcome them--if you understand the breakthrough principles of behavioral economics and apply them in your own retirement planning. Dr. Gregory Salsbury identifies some of the classic cognitive biases and behavioral mistakes most of us keep making when it comes to retirement planning. For example: "Why will people drive 45 minutes to use a $2.00 coupon? Why won t people sell a poor performing stock just because they inherited it from grandma? Why do people spend differently with a credit card than they do with cash? Why do people believe that they paid no income taxes because they received a refund? Y"ou ll learn why the financial meltdown has amplified the impact of these all-too-human cognitive mistakes and discover ideas for addressing them. The bottom line for your bottom line is that retirement can no longer be ignored, viewed as a single event, relegated to a zone, or romanticized. Instead, you must understand how every spending and financial decision you make from here on can impact the way you will spend your golden years. "Retirementology "attempts to help you do just that. Retirement planning: right brain versus left brain "Why these different areas of the brain impact financial decisions--and what to do about it" "" It s "real money! " De-layering your finances "How to overcome the psychological tricks that separate you from your money" "" Family matters: managing financial support decisions for your extended family "Choosing between your family or your retirement" "" Get long-term smart "How longevity, inflation, volatility, and your own expectations impact your retirement goals" "	From the AshesA DEADLY CONSPIRACY Graduate students Jonathan and Michael Rickner, sons of eminent archaeologist Sir William Rickner, are no strangers to historical mysteries and archaeological adventures.

The Blue Light ProjectFrom one of Canada's finest writers comes a masterful novel about the clash of art and advertising, the cultish grip of celebrity and the intense connections that can form in times of crisis. An unidentified man storms a television studio where KiddieFame, a controversial children's talent show wherein kids who are too talented are "killed off," is being filmed. He is armed with an explosive device, and issues only a single demand: an interview with journalist Thom Pegg. It's a strange request, everyone agrees. A disgraced former investigative journalist, caught fabricating sources, Pegg is down on his luck and working for a lowly tabloid. The demand surprises everyone - Pegg most of all, and he is reluctant to play a role. But pressure from federal authorities leaves little choice, and so it is that Thom Pegg finds himself the envy of all the high-level journalists on hand as he makes his way into the darkened studio to uncover the truth. Outside, as the hostage taking heads into its third day, enthralled and horrified onlookers watch the drama unfold through a constant stream of media speculation and rumours that race through the crowd. In the throes of this crisis two characters - one running from former glory and the other from corporate burnout - meet and instinctively connect. Eve is an Olympic gold medalist and much-loved local daughter who jogs the city's streets at night and searches for her long-lost brother, Ali, in its shadowy corners. Rabbit is a secretive street artist who is just completing a massive project involving strange installations on the rooftops of hundreds of buildings throughout the city. Both carry the scars of their pasts, and seem to be searching for a way to become whole. It's a fearful time, when people have serious doubts about the future and about each other, yet are compelled to come together to vent their anxiety and make themselves heard. Outside the studio, chaos reigns, and Eve and Rabbit must navigate police checkpoints as they skirt the unruly masses in pursuit of the truth of what happened to Ali. Inside the studio, however, it's all about control, as Pegg listens to the hostage taker's story and begins to realize the terrible, violent truth about what he has planned. When the crisis comes to a head, events collide and riots grip the streets. Prospects seem bleak as the tension of the hostage taking is unleashed upon the city. But when Rabbit's secret installation is finally activated, people are shocked into seeing the power beauty still has in this world, and into recognizing the real possibility of hope. The Blue Light Projectis a hard-hitting and emotionally wrought commentary on the forces that attract and repel us, and the faith that enables us to continue, even in our darkest hours.

A chance for me to be satisfied and content and maybe even on occasion deliriously, amazingly, exuberantly fulfilled. So this is where I am, on a train that's out of control, and I am not just a passenger. I'm the one shoveling the furnace full of coal to keep it going fast and faster.

The truth is, I didn't know I was looking for this until I found Will, but I must've been, all this time. And now it is not random, it is not fate, it is not being swept away. This is my choice. And I don't know how to stop. Or even if I want to.

In this first in a series of beautifully illustrated books that celebrate the power and beauty of the animal kingdom, Catherine Feher-Elston considers the raven in the contexts of mythology, folklore, history, and science. From the raven's role as trickster in Native American religion to his ability to captivate ornithologists and biologists with his intriguing behaviors, Ravensongpays tribute to the elegance and grandeur of two of America's most ubiquitous avian species.	Pages from the Goncourt JournalsNo evocation of Parisian life in the second half of the nineteenth century can match that found in the journals of the brothers Goncourt The journal of the brothers Edmond and Jules de Goncourt is one of the masterpieces of nineteenth-century French literature, a work that in its richness of color, variety, and seemingly casual perfection bears comparison with the great paintings of their friends and contemporaries the Impressionists. Born nearly ten years apart into a French aristocratic family, the two brothers formed an extraordinarily productive and enduring literary partnership, collaborating on novels, criticism, and plays that pioneered the new aesthetic of naturalism. But the brothers' talents found their most memorable outlet in their journal, which is at once a chronicle of an era, an intimate glimpse into their lives, and the purest expression of a nascent modern sensibility preoccupied with sex and art, celebrity and self-exposure. The Goncourts visit slums, brothels, balls, department stores, and imperial receptions; they argue over art and politics and trade merciless gossip with and about Hugo, Baudelaire, Degas, Flaubert, Zola, Rodin, and many others. And in 1871, Edmond maintains a vigil as his brother dies a slow and agonizing death from syphilis, recording every detail in the journal that he would continue to maintain alone for another two decades.	The Crossley ID Guide: Eastern BirdsThis stunningly illustrated book from acclaimed birder and photographer Richard Crossley revolutionizes field guide design by providing the first real-life approach to identification. Whether you are a beginner, expert, or anywhere in between, The Crossley ID Guidewill vastly improve your ability to identify birds. Unlike other guides, which provide isolated individual photographs or illustrations, this is the first book to feature large, lifelike scenes for each species. These scenes--640 in all--are composed from more than 10,000 of the author's images showing birds in a wide range of views--near and far, from different angles, in various plumages and behaviors, including flight, and in the habitat in which they live. These beautiful compositions show how a bird's appearance changes with distance, and give equal emphasis to characteristics experts use to identify birds: size, structure and shape, behavior, probability, and color. This is the first book to convey all of these features visually--in a single image--and to reinforce them with accurate, concise text. Each scene provides a wealth of detailed visual information that invites and rewards careful study, but the most important identification features can be grasped instantly by anyone. By making identification easier, more accurate, and more fun than ever before, The Crossley ID Guidewill completely redefine how its users look at birds. Essential for all birders, it also promises to make new birders of many people who have despaired of using traditional guides. Revolutionary.

Birds have ever been the symbols of our highest aspirations. As divine messengers, symbols of our yearning for the heavens, or avatars of glorious song and colour, they have stirred our imaginations from the moment we first looked into the sky. Whether as the Christian dove, or Quetzalcoatl--the Aztec Plumed Serpent--or in Plato's vision of the human soul growing wings and feathers, religion and philosophy have looked to birds as representatives of our better selves--that part of us not bound to the earth. With the passion of a birdwatcher and hoarder of words, Gibson has spent fifteen years collecting the literary and artistic forms our affinity for birds has taken over the centuries. Birds appear again and again in mythology and folk tales, and in literature by writers as diverse as Ovid, Thomas Hardy, Kafka, Thoreau and T.S. Eliot. They've been omens, allegories, disguises and guides; they've been worshipped, eaten, feared and loved. Nor does Gibson forget the fascination they hold for science, as the Galapagos finches did for Darwin. Birds figure charmingly and tellingly in the work of such nature writers as Gilbert White, Peter Matthiessen, Farley Mowat and Barry Lopez. Gorgeously illustrated, woven from centuries of human response to the delights of the feathered tribes, The Bedside Book of Birds is for anyone who is aware of birds, and for everyone who is intrigued by the artistic forms that humanity has created to represent its soul.	Seduction and Betrayal: Women and LiteratureThe novelist and essayist Elizabeth Hardwick is one of contemporary America's most brilliant writers, and Seduction and Betrayal, in which she considers the careers of women writers as well as the larger question of the presence of women in literature, is her most passionate and concentrated work of criticism. A gallery of unforgettable portraits--of Virginia Woolf and Zelda Fitzgerald, Dorothy Wordsworth and Jane Carlyle--as well as a provocative reading of such works as Wuthering Heights, Hedda Gabler, and the poems of Sylvia Plath, Seduction and Betrayalis a virtuoso performance, a major writer's reckoning with the relations between men and women, women and writing, writing and life.	5927	6186	1863	192	5011	92069	-1	27792	71	274\$\$Shelley: The PursuitShelley: The Pursuitis the book with which Richard Holmes--the finest literary biographer of our day--made his name. Dispensing with the long-established Victorian picture of Shelley as a blandly ethereal character, Holmes projects a startling image of "a darker and more earthly, crueler and more capable figure." Expelled from college, disowned by his aristocratic father, driven from England, Shelley led a life marked from its beginning to its early end by a violent rejection of society; he embraced rebellion and disgrace without thought of the cost to himself or to others. Here we have the real Shelley--radical agitator, atheist, apostle of free love, but above all a brilliant and uncompromising poetic innovator, whose life and work have proved an essential inspiration to poets as varied as W.B. Yeats and Allen Ginsberg.	My Wars Are Laid Away in Books: The Life of Emily Dickinson	Posthumous Keats: A Personal BiographyPosthumous Keatsis the result of Stanley Plumly's twenty years of reflection on the enduring afterlife of one of England's greatest Romanticists. John Keats's famous epitaph--"Here lies One Whose Name was writ in Water"--helped cement his reputation as the archetype of the genius cut off before his time. Keats, dead of tuberculosis at twenty-five, saw his mortality as fatal to his poetry, and therein, Plumly argues, lies his tragedy: Keats thought he had failed in his mission "to be among the English poets."In this close narrative study, Plumly meditates on the chances for poetic immortality--an idea that finds its purest expression in Keats, whose poetic influence remains immense. Incisive in its observations and beautifully written, Posthumous Keatsis an ode to an unsuspecting young poet--a man who, against the odds of his culture and critics, managed to achieve the unthinkable: the elevation of the lyric poem to sublime and tragic status.	The Life and Death of Mary WollstonecraftWitty, courageous and unconventional, Mary Wollstonecraft was one of the most controversial figures of her day. She published "A Vindication of the Rights of Woman"; travelled to revolutionary France and lived through the Terror and the destruction of the incipient French feminist movement; produced an illegitimate daughter; and married William Godwin before dying in childbed at the age of thirty-eight. Often embattled and bitterly disappointed, she never gave up her radical ideas or her belief that courage and honesty would triumph over convention. Winner of the Whitbread First Book Prize in 1974, this haunting biography achieved wide critical acclaim. Writing in the "New Statesman", J. H. Plumb called it, 'Wide, penetrating, sympathetic. There is no better book on Mary Wollstonecraft, nor is there likely to be'.	Seduction and Betrayal: Women and LiteratureThe novelist and essayist Elizabeth Hardwick is one of contemporary America's most brilliant writers, and Seduction and Betrayal, in which she considers the careers of women writers as well as the larger question of the presence of women in literature, is her most passionate and concentrated work of criticism.

KeatsAndrew Motion's dramatic narration of Keats's life is the first in a generation to take a fresh look at this great English Romantic poet. Unlike previous biographers, Motion pays close attention to the social and political worlds Keats inhabited. Making incisive use of the poet's inimitable letters, Motion presents a masterful account. "Motion has given us a new Keats, one who is skinned alive, a genius who wrote in a single month all the poems we cherish, a victim who was tormented by the best doctors of the age. . . . This portrait, stripped of its layers of varnish and restored to glowing colours, should last us for another generation."--Edmund White, The Observer Review "Keats's letters fairly leap off the page. . . . [Motion] listens for the 'freely associating inquiry and incomparable verve and dash,' the 'headlong charge,' of Keats's jazzlike improvisations, which give us, like no other writing in English, the actual rush of a man thinking, a mind hurtling forward unpredictably and sweeping us along."--Morris Dickstein, New York Times Book Review "Scrupulous and eloquent."--Gregory Feeley, Philadelphia Inquirer	6186	1470	5945	910	833	13780	-1	22241	-1	274
Moab Is My Washpot	David Attenborough's Life on Air: Memoirs of a Broadcaster	Dear FattyDawn French is one of the greatest comedy actresses of our time, with a career spanning nearly three decades and encompassing a vast and brilliant array of characters that would eventually establish her as a national treasure. She first appeared on the British entertainment scene as part of the groundbreaking alternative comedy group, the Comic Strip, which marked a radical departure from the more traditional comedy acts of the time. Later came the all-female Girls on Top with Jennifer Saunders, Ruby Wax and Tracy Ullman. Then, as part of the wildly successful duo, French and Saunders, Dawn helped create a repertoire of brilliantly observed recurring characters parodying popular culture and impersonating everything from Madonna and Harry Potter to The Exorcist. Dawn's more recent role in The Vicar of Dibley again has showcased not only her talent but also her ability to take a controversial issue and make it mainstream and funny. From her early years as an RAF child to her flat-sharing antics with Jennifer Saunders, from her outspoken views on sizeism to her marriage to Lenny Henry, Dear Fatty will chronicle the fascinating and hilarious rise of a complex, dynamic and unstoppable woman.	Red Carpets and Other Banana Skins: The AutobiographyRevealing himself to be a consummate storyteller, stage and screen star Everett ("My Best Friend's Wedding") pens a delightfully witty memoir in which he reveals his life experiences as an up-and-coming actor, detailing everything from the eccentricities of the British upper class to the madness of Hollywood.	Look Back in HungerJo Brand is one of Britain's funniest and best-loved comedians. With a sharp eye for the absurd and in her own unique voice she tells her story for the first time. What possessed her to become a professional comedian in the cut-throat world of stand-up comedy after ten years as a psychiatric nurse? How did she deal with late night drunken audiences? Raised in middle class comfort, she left home in her teens to live with someone entirely inappropriate. Her parents were aghast at her behaviour and attempted to rein in her excesses, finally giving up when she demonstrated that she was not headed for the life of a nun. From her early years growing up in a small south coast town with two brothers who toughened her up, to emerging on stage as 'The Sea Monster', Jo Brand tells it like it is with wit, candour and a wonderful sense that life can be ridiculous but there's always a funny side.	Screen Burn	2896	192	910	2136	5575	69859	-1	10476	71	158\$\$Back StoryDavid Mitchell, who you may know for his inappropriate anger on every TV panel show except Never Mind the Buzzcocks, his look of permanent discomfort on C4 sex comedy Peep Show, his online commenter-baiting in The Observer or just for wearing a stick-on moustache in That Mitchell and Webb Look, has written a book about his life. As well as giving a specific account of every single time he's scored some smack, this disgusting memoir also details: * the singular, pitbull-infested charm of the FRP ('Flat Roofed Pub') * the curious French habit of injecting everyone in the arse rather than the arm * why, by the time he got to Cambridge, he really, really needed a drink * the pain of being denied a childhood birthday party at McDonalds * the satisfaction of writing jokes about suicide * how doing quite a lot of walking around London helps with his sciatica * trying to pretend he isn't a total **** at Robert Webb's wedding * that he has fallen in love at LOT, but rarely done anything about it * why it would be worse to bump into Michael Palin than Hitler on holiday * that he's not David Mitchell the novelist. Despite what David Miliband might think	My Favourite People 1978 to 1988From the author's chronic kleptomania to the moving search for his mother's grave years after she died, from his obsession with joining (going so far as to become a member of Chickens Lib) to his first forays into making people laugh (not always intentionally), this title focuses on the formative years that make us all.	SpectaclesWhen I began writing this book, I went home to see if my mum had kept some of my stuff. What I found was that she hadn't kept some of it. She had kept all of it - every bus ticket, postcard, school report - from the moment I was born to the moment I finally had the confidence to turn round and say 'Why is our house full of this shit?' Sadly, a recycling 'incident' destroyed the bulk of this archive. This has meant two things: firstly, Dear Reader, you will never get to see countless drawings of wizards, read a poem about corn on the cob, or marvel at the kilos of brown flowers I so lovingly pressed as a child. Secondly, it's left me with no choice but to actually write this thing myself. This, my first ever book, will answer questions such as 'Is Mary Berry real?', 'Is it true you wear a surgical truss?' and 'Is a non-spherically symmetric gravitational pull from outside the observable universe responsible for some of the observed motion of large objects such as galactic clusters in the universe?' Most of this book is true. I have, of course, amplified my more positive characteristics in an effort to make you like me. Thank you for reading.	Small Man in a BookRob Brydon tells story of his slow ascent to fame and fortune in Small Man in a Book. A multi-award-winning actor, writer, comedian and presenter known for his warmth, humour and inspired impressions, Rob Brydon has quickly become one of our very favourite entertainers. But there was a time when it looked like all we'd hear of Rob was his gifted voice. Growing up in South Wales, Rob had a passion for radio and soon the Welsh airwaves resounded to his hearty burr. However, these were followed by years of misadventure and struggle, before, in the TV series Marion and Geoff and Gavin and Stacey, Rob at last tickled the nation's funny bone. The rest, as they say, is history. Or in his case autobiography. Small Man in a Book is Rob Brydon's funny, heartfelt, honest, sometimes sad, but mainly funny, memoir of how a young man from Wales very, very slowly became an overnight success. Rob Brydon was brought up in Wales, where his career began on radio and as a voiceover artist. After a brief stint working for the Home Shopping Network he co-wrote and performed in his breakthrough show, the darkly funny Human Remains. He has since starred in the immensely popular Gavin and Stacey, Steve Coogan's partner in The Trip, and was the host of Would I Lie to You? and The Rob Brydon Show. He now lives in London with his wife and five children.	I Can Make You HateWould you like to eat whatever you want and still lose weight? Who wouldn't? Keep dreaming, imbecile. In the meantime, if you'd like to read something that alternates between laugh-out-loud-funny and apocalyptically angry, keep holding this book. Steal it if necessary. In his latest collection of rants, raves, hastily spluttered articles and scarcely literate scrawl, Charlie Brooker proves that there is almost nothing in this universe, big or small, that can't reduce a human being to a state of pure blind hatred. It won't help you lose weight, feel smarter, sleep more soundly, or feel happier about yourself. It will provide you with literally hours of distraction and merriment. It can also be used to stun an intruder, if you hit him with it correctly (hint: strike hard, using the spine, on the bridge of the nose). Only a prick wouldn't buy this book. Don't be that prick.	We Need to Talk About...Aged just 17, Kevin Bridges walked on stage for the first time in a Glasgow comedy club and brought the house down. He only had a five-minute set but in that short time he discovered that he really could earn a living from making people laugh. Kevin began life as a shy, nerve-ridden school-boy, whose weekly highlights included a cake-bombing attack by the local youths. Reaching his teens, he followed his true calling as the class clown, and was soon after arrested for kidnapping Hugh Grant from his local cinema on a quiet Saturday night. This was a guy going somewhere - off the rails seeming most likely. Kevin's trademark social commentary, sharp one-liners and laugh-out-loud humour blend with his reflections on his Glaswegian childhood and the journey he's taken to become one of the most-loved comedians of our time.	2896	2136	4855	192	910	147378	-1	48384	71	274
The Space MerchantsIn a vastly overpopulated near-future world, businesses have taken the place of governments and now hold all political power. States exist merely to ensure the survival of huge transnational corporations. Advertising has become hugely aggressive and boasts some of the world's most powerful executives. Through advertising, the public is constantly deluded into thinking that all the products on the market improve the quality of life. However, the most basic elements are incredibly scarce, including water and fuel. The planet Venus has just been visited and judged fit for human settlement, despite its inhospitable surface and climate; colonists would have to endure a harsh climate for many generations until the planet could be terraformed. Mitch Courtenay is a star-class copywriter in the Fowler Schocken advertising agency and has been assigned the ad campaign that would attract colonists to Venus, but a lot more is happening than he knows about. Mitch is soon thrown into a world of danger, mystery, and intrigue, where the people in his life are never quite what they seem, and his loyalties and core beliefs will be put to the test.	Mission of GravityCover Artist: Ed Emshwiller Mission of Gravityis an sf novel by Hal Clement.

Its 1st cloth publication was in '54. It was 1st published in paper in '58. Along with the novel itself, many editions (& most recent editions) of the book also include Whirligig World, an essay on creating the planet Mesklin that was published in the 6/53 Astounding.

For a profit & adventure Barlennan would sail thousands of miles across uncharted waters, into regions where gravity played strange tricks. He'd dare the perils of strange tribes & stranger creatures--even dicker with those aliens from beyond the skies, though the concept of another world was unknown to the inhabitants of the planet of Mesklin. But in spite of the incredible technology of the strangers & without regard for their enormous size, Barlennan had the notion of turning the deal to an unsuspected advantage for himself--a considerable enterprise for a being very much resembling a 15" caterpillar!

The powerful narcotic syncophine, commonly known as Flare, comes from only one source: the oil of the gargantuan whale-like beasts that swim the dust sea of Nullaqua. It was John Newhouse's addiction to the substance that made him a dealer and forced him to move to this airless, inhospitable planet But when the all-powerful galactic Confederacy declares Flare illegal, the needs of Newhouse and his clientele leave the desperate off-worlder no choice but to sign on as an able seaman aboard a dustwhaler and hunt the giant creatures himself.

Dead Lucky: Life After Death on Mount EverestLincoln Hall's breathtaking account of surviving a night in Everest's "death zone." Lincoln Hall likes to say that on the evening of May 25, 2006, he died on Everest. Indeed, Hall attempted to climb the mountain during a deadly season in which eleven people perished. And he was, in fact, pronounced dead, after collapsing from altitude sickness. Two Sherpas spent hours trying to revive him, but as darkness fell, word came via radio from the expedition's leader that they should descend in order to save themselves. The news of Hall's death traveled rapidly from mountaineering websites to news media around the world, and ultimately to his family back in Australia. Early the next morning, however, an American guide, climbing with two clients and a Sherpa, was startled to find Hall sitting cross-legged on a sharp crest of the summit ridge. In this page-turning account of survival against all odds, Hall chronicles in fascinating detail the days and nights that led up to his fateful night in Mount Everest's "death zone." His story is all the more miraculous given his climbing history. Hall had been part of Australia's first attempt to reach the top of Everest in 1984 but had not done any major climbing for many years, having set aside his passion in order to support his family. While others in the team achieved their dream during this 1984 expedition, Hall was forced to turn back due to illness. Thus, his triumph in reaching the summit at the age of fifty is a story unto itself. So, too, is Hall's description of his family's experience back in Australia, as sudden grief turned to relief and joy in a matter of hours. Rarely has there been such a thrilling narrative of one man's encounter with the world's tallest mountain.	Everest : Mountain Without MercyDavid Breashears, the first American to scale Everest twice, was a veteran of nine previous Himalayan filmmaking expeditions when he agreed to lead what became his most challenging filmmaking experience. The expedition was organized by large-format motion picture producer MacGillivray Freeman Films and was comprised of an international team of climbers. Their goal was to carry a specially modified 48-pound IMAX motion picture camera to the summit of Everest and return from the top of the world with the first footage ever shot there in this spectacular format. A stunningly illustrated portrait of life and death in a hostile, high-altitude environment where no human can survive for long, Everest invites you to join Breashears, his climbers, and his crew as they make photographic history. Author Broughton Coburn traces each step of the team's progress toward a rendezvous with history - and suddenly you're on the scene of a disaster that riveted the world's attention. Everest incorporates a first-person, on-the-scene account of the most tragic event in the mountain's history: The May 10, 1996, blizzard that claimed eight lives, including two of the world's top climbing expedition leaders. It is a chronicle of the courage and cooperation that resulted in the rescue of several men and women who were trapped on the lethal, windswept slopes. Everest is also a tale of triumph. In a struggle to overcome both the physical and emotional effects of the disaster on Everest, Breashears and his team rise to the challenge of achieving their goal - humbled by the mountain's overwhelming power, yet exhilarated by their own accomplishment.	Dark Summit: The True Story of Everest's Most Controversial SeasonIn early May 2006, a young British climber named David Sharp lay dying near the top of Mount Everest while forty other climbers walked past him on their way to the summit. A week later, Lincoln Hall, a seasoned Australian climber, was left for dead near the same spot. Hall's death was reported around the world, but the next day he was found alive after spending the night on the upper mountain with no food and no shelter. If David Sharp's death was shocking, it was not singular: despite unusually good weather, ten others died attempting to reach the summit that year. In this meticulous inquiry into what went wrong, Nick Heil tells the full story of the deadliest year on Everest since the infamous season of 1996. He introduces Russell Brice, the outfitter who has done more than anyone to provide access to the summit via the mountain's north side---and who some believe was partially responsible for Sharp's death. As more climbers attempt the summit each year, Heil shows how increasingly risky expeditions and unscrupulous outfitters threaten to turn Everest into a deadly circus. Written by an experienced climber and outdoor writer, Dark Summit is both a riveting account of a notorious climbing season and a troubling investigation into whether the pursuit of the ultimate mountaineering prize has spiraled out of control.	Above the Clouds: The Diaries of a High-Altitude Mountaineer	One Mountain Thousand Summits: The Untold Story Tragedy and True Heroism on K2An insider's account of one of the deadliest and most controversial tragedies in mountaineering history-the 2008 K2 disaster.  When eleven men perished on the slopes of K2 in August 2008, it was one of the deadliest single events in Himalayan climbing and made headlines around the world. Yet non of the surviving western climbers could explain precisely what happened. Their memories were self-admittedly fogged by exhaustion, hypoxia, and hallucinations. The truth of what happened lies with four Sherpa guides who were largely ignored by the mainstream media in the aftermath of the tragedy, who lost two of their own during the incident, and whose heroic efforts saved the lives of at least four climbers. Based on his numerous trips to Nepal and in-depth interviews he conducted with these unacknowledged heroes, the other survivors, and the families of the lost climbers, alpinist and veteran climbing writer Freddie Wilkinson presents the true story of what actually occurred on the "savage" mountain. This work combines a criticism of the mainstream press's less-than-complete coverage of the tragedy and an insightful portrait of the lives of 21st-century Sherpas into an intelligent, white-knuckled adventure narrative.	High Crimes: the Fate of Everest in an Age of GreedHigh Crimesis journalist Michael Kodas's gripping account of life on top of the world--where man is every bit as deadly as Mother Nature. In the years following the publication of Into Thin Air, much has changed on Mount Everest. Among all the books documenting the glorious adventures in mountains around the world, none details how the recent infusion of wealthy climbers is drawing crime to the highest place on the planet. The change is caused both by a tremendous boom in traffic, and a new class of parasitic and predatory adventurer. It's likely that Jon Krakauer would not recognize the camps that he visited on Mount Everest almost a decade ago. This book takes readers on a harrowing tour of the criminal underworld on the slopes of the world's most majestic mountain. High Crimesdescribes two major expeditions: the tragic story of Nils Antezana, a climber who died on Everest after he was abandoned by his guide; as well as the author's own story of his participation in the Connecticut Everest Expedition, guided by George Dijmarescu and his wife and climbing partner, Lhakpa Sherpa. Dijmarescu, who at first seemed well-intentioned and charming, turned increasingly hostile to his own wife, as well as to the author and the other women on the team. By the end of the expedition, the three women could not travel unaccompanied in base camp due to the threat of violence. Those that tried to stand against the violence and theft found that the worst of the intimidation had followed them home to Connecticut. Beatings, thefts, drugs, prostitution, coercion, threats, and abandonment on the highest slopes of Everest and other mountains have become the rule rather than the exception. Kodas describes many such experiences, and explores the larger issues these stories raise with thriller-like intensity.	5586	5575	192	1264	5162	-1	-1	38700	-1	158\$\$Savage Summit: The True Stories of the First Five Women Who Climbed K2, the World's Most Feared MountainThough not as tall as Everest, the "Savage Mountain" is far more dangerous. Located on the border of China and Pakistan, K2 has some of the harshest climbing conditions in the world. Ninety women have scaled Everest but of the six women who reached the summit of K2, three lost their lives on the way back down the mountain and two have since died on other climbs. In Savage Summit, Jennifer Jordan shares the tragic, compelling, inspiring, and extraordinary true stories of a handful of courageous women -- mothers and daughters, wives and lovers, poets and engineers -- who defeated this formidable mountain yet ultimately perished in pursuit of their dreams.

Climbing High: A Woman's Account of Surviving the Everest TragedyOn May 10, 1996, Lene Gammelgaard became the first Scandinavian woman to reach the summit of Mount Everest. But a raging storm and human error conspired to turn triumph into catastrophe. Eight of her team's climbers, including its renowned leader Scott Fischer, perished in a tragedy that would make headlines around the world. In her riveting account, Gammelgaard takes us from her weeks of determined training to the exhilaration of arriving in Nepal to the arduous climb and deadly storm that forced her and her fellow climbers to huddle throughout the night, hoping to stay alive. Gammelgaard also writes movingly of Everest's awesome beauty; of the passion and commitment required to face the daunting challenge of climbing to high altitudes; and of the complex personal relationships forged in the pursuit of such dangerous ventures. Arlene Blum, author of the classic account of women and mountaineering, Annapurna: A Woman's Place,calls Climbing High"an honest and deeply personal account."	K2: Triumph and TragedyK2 is the second highest mountain in the world, at 8611 metres only a couple of hundred metres lower than Everest and is one of the most unrelenting and testing of the worlds 8000-metre peaks. Jim Curran came to K2 as a climbing cameraman with an unsuccessful British expedition, but stayed on through the climbing season. This is his account of the dramatic events of that summer, a story of ambitions both achieved and thwarted on a mountain which all high-altitude climbers take the most pride in overcoming. In 1986 K2 took its toll of those ambitions. Curran vividly describes the moments that contribute to the exhilaration of climbing on the world's most demanding mountain, and he assesses the tragedy of that summer with compassion and impartiality. K2, "the savage mountain", is the second-highest peak in the world - and the most difficult to climb. In 1986, it was the site of both dazzling triumph and great loss as twenty-seven men and women reached the top but thirteen died trying. Curran was there to record it all in words and photographs: courage and obsession, luminous success and thwarted ambition.	No Way Down: Life and Death on K2In this riveting work of narrative nonfiction, journalist Graham Bowley re-creates one of the most dramatic tales of death and survival in mountaineering history, vividly taking readers through the tragic 2008 K2 ascent that claimed the lives of eleven climbers, severely injured two others, and made headlines around the world. With its near-perfect pyramid shape, the 28,251-foot K2--the world's second-highest mountain, some 800 feet shorter than the legendary Everest hundreds of miles to the south--has lured serious climbers for decades. In 2008, near the end of a brief climbing season cut even shorter by bad weather, no fewer than ten international teams--some experienced, others less prepared--crowded the mountain's dangerous slopes with their Sherpas and porters, waiting to ascend. Finally, on August 1, they were able to set off. But hindered by poor judgment, lack of equipment, and overcrowded conditions, the last group did not summit until nearly 8 p.m., hours later than planned. Then disaster struck when a huge ice chunk from above the Bottleneck, a deadly 300-foot avalanche-prone gulley just below the summit, came loose and destroyed the fixed guide ropes. More than a dozen climbers and porters still above the Bottleneck--many without oxygen and some with no headlamps--faced the near impossibility of descending in the blackness with no guideline and no protection. Over the course of the chaotic night, some would miraculously make it back. Others would not. Based on in-depth interviews with surviving climbers and many Sherpas, porters, and family and friends of the deceased, No Way Down reveals for the first time the full dimensions of this harrowing drama.	Ghosts of Everest: The Search for Mallory & IrvineDid Mallory and Irvine reach Everest's summit 30 years before Hillary and Tenzing? Until now, clues about what happened to these two Everest pioneers had been scant and misleading. Until now, no one has known whether they reached the summit. Until now, no one has known where or how they perished.  This is a detective story of the first order. It is the story not just of Mallory and Irvine's last climb, but of the team of climbers and researchers who, together, found the body of perhaps Britain's greatest mountaineer and uncovered the startling story he had waited so long to reveal. Written by the three key members of the team, and incorporating extensive interviews with other team members, GHOSTS OF EVEREST is the dramatic unfolding of both the 1999 and 1924 expeditions, woven together into a compelling narrative.  This book is the definitive account and has become an instant classic.	5162	1684	3452	5586	2506	141361	-1	46932	71	158

It stopped being a toy when great new jeliners began to crash, caraccidents multiplied astronomically and a mounting toll of deaths and disasters revealed its true potential.

Layers of HerPeople always say it's what's on the inside that matters. If that's the case, I'm screwed. On the outside, everything looks put together -- blonde hair, blue eyes, tall and lean. By society's standards, I'd be considered attractive. But f*ck society, I know what I am. I know what I'm made of. The recessive genes that reared their heads and created a decent looking package on the outside don't make me who I am. What about all the evil lurking inside?

The outcome...Something completely unexpected. Adriana Dostov pegged Luca Martuccio from day one: gorgeous, talented, arrogant, a man who has had difficulty committing to one woman in the past. He is known in fashion circles as the player with a scandalous history. So when the girls in her ballet troupe suggest she gives up her virginity to him, she doesn't say no.

Adriana discovers Luca isn't just walking sex on a stick - he has a wildly passionate side, a lost soul who has suffered just as much grief as her. And it could be, they're exactly what the other one needs.	4466	868	5656	3199	3276	47587	-1	39230	71	48

Evidence of Things Not SeenWhen high school junior Tommy Smythe goes missing, everyone has a theory about what happened to him. Tommy was adopted, so maybe he ran away to find his birth parents. He was an odd kid, often deeply involved in his own thoughts about particle physics, so maybe he just got distracted and wandered off. He was last seen at a pull-out off the highway, so maybe someone drove up and snatched him. Or maybe he slipped into a parallel universe. Tommy believes that everything is possible, and that until something can be proven false, it is possibly true. So as long as Tommy's whereabouts are undetermined, he could literally be anywhere. Told in a series of first-person narratives from people who knew Tommy and third-person chapters about people who find the things Tommy left behind--his red motorbike, his driving goggles, pages from his notebook--Particles explores themes of loneliness, connectedness, and the role we play in creating our own realities.	1160	4594	1215	4512	2589	116194	-1	-1	-1	-1

Practical Wisdom: The Right Way To Do the Right ThingA reasoned yet urgent call to embrace and protect the essential, practical human quality that has been drummed out of our lives: wisdom.  It's in our nature to want to succeed. It's also human nature to want to do right. But we've lost how to balance the two. How do we get it back? Practical Wisdomcan help. "Practical wisdom" is the essential human quality that combines the fruits of our individual experiences with our empathy and intellect-an aim that Aristotle identified millennia ago. It's learning "the right way to do the right thing in a particular circumstance, with a particular person, at a particular time." But we have forgotten how to do this. In Practical Wisdom, Barry Schwartz and Kenneth Sharpe illuminate how to get back in touch with our wisdom: how to identify it, cultivate it, and enact it, and how to make ourselves healthier, wealthier, and wiser.

The Essential Tillich"With this volume, Paul Tillich joins the ranks of the great Christian theologians such as Augustine of Hippo and Thomas Aquinas. . . .This volume, compiled by a noted minister and scholar, offers to the theological student, church worker, or, indeed, any serious reader struggling with the existential question, a tantalizing and illuminating introduction to perhaps the greatest mind of twentieth-century Protestant theology."--Booklist "Church testifies to the power Tillich provides him for his pastoral work, his intellectual formulation and his personal life. He projects, quite properly, that the 'essential' Tillich can do the same for others. . . ."--Christian Century "This book summarizes in Tillich's own words much of the best of his thought, still highly relevant today."--Library Journal "[Church] helps Tillich speak to an audience unfamiliar with the breadth and depth of his thought."--Religious Studies Review	Thinking of Answers: Questions in the Philosophy of Everyday LifeIn his acclaimed columns in the London "Times "and "Prospect," A. C. Grayling often responds to provocative questions posed by editors and readers. These questions serve as the basis for the essays in "Thinking of Answers," among them searching examinations of the following: Are human beings especially prone to self-deception? If beauty existed only in the eye of the beholder, would that make it an unimportant quality? Are human rights political? Can ethics be derived from evolution by natural selection? If both sides in a conflict passionately believe theirs is a just cause, does this mean the idea of justice is empty? Does being happy make us good? And does being good make us happy? As in his previous books on philosophy for the general public, including "Meditations for the Humanist "and "Life, Sex and Ideas," rather than presenting a set of categorical answers, Grayling offers suggestions for how to think about every aspect of the question at hand and arrive at one's own conclusion. Nobody can read "Thinking of Answers "without being fully engaged, for Grayling challenges with his intellect and inspires with his humanity.	Curious?: Discover the Missing Ingredient to a Fulfilling Life	482	6487	6540	102	2257	25742	-1	14347	5	158\$\$On MisEducationThis collection of Chomsky's influential writings on education builds a larger understanding of our educational needs, starting with the changing role of schools today, yet broadening our view toward new models of public education for citizenship.	Hacking Your Education: Escape Lectures, Save Thousands, and Hustle Your Way to a Brighter FutureIt's no secret that college doesn't prepare students for the real world. Student loan debt recently eclipsed credit card debt for the first time in history and now tops one trillion dollars. And the throngs of unemployed graduates chasing the same jobs makes us wonder whether there's a better way to "make it" in today's marketplace. There is--and Dale Stephens is proof of that. In Hacking Your Education, Stephens speaks to a new culture of "hackademics" who think college diplomas are antiquated. Stephens shows how he and dozens of others have hacked their education, and how you can, too. You don't need to be a genius or especially motivated to succeed outside school. The real requirements are much simpler: curiosity, confidence, and grit. Hacking Your Education offers valuable advice to current students as well as those who decided to skip college. Stephens teaches you to create opportunities for yourself and design your curriculum--inside or outside the classroom. Whether your dream is to travel the world, build a startup, or climb the corporate ladder, Stephens proves you can do it now, rather than waiting for life to start after "graduation" day.	Chomsky for BeginnersNoam Chomsky, "arguably the most important intellectual alive" (The New York Times), first became famous through his work in linguistics. Chomsky's second career, as a political/analyst/critic/activist is harder to categorize. Chomsky for Beginners presents a concise yet comprehensive introduction to this political gadfly and "media critic", whose ideas are in deadly opposition to the kow-towing mass media.	Only One Thing Can Save Us: Why America Needs a New Kind of Labor MovementIs labor's day over or is labor the only real answer for our time? In his new book, National Book Critics Circle Award finalist and labor lawyer Thomas Geoghegan argues that even as organized labor seems to be crumbling, a revived--but different--labor movement is the only way to stabilize the economy and save the middle class. But the inequality now reshaping the country goes beyond money and income: the places we work have become ever more rigid hierarchies. Geoghegan makes his argument for labor with stories, sometimes humorous but more often chilling, about the problems working people like his own clients--from cabdrivers to schoolteachers--now face, increasingly powerless in our union-free economy. He explains why a new kind of labor movement (and not just more higher education) is the real program the Democrats should push--not just to save the middle class from bankruptcy but to revive Keynes's original and sometimes forgotten ideas for getting the rich to invest and reducing our balance of trade, and to promote John Dewey's vision of a "democratic way of life," one that would start in the schools and continue in our places of work. A "public policy" book that is compulsively readable, Only One Thing Can Save Usis vintage Geoghegan, blending acerbic, witty commentary with unparalleled insight into the real dynamics (and human experience) of working in America today.	An Ethic of Excellence: Building a Culture of Craftsmanship with StudentsDrawing from his own remarkable experience as a veteran classroom teacher (still in the classroom), Ron Berger gives us a vision of educational reform that transcends standards, curriculum, and instructional strategies. He argues for a paradigm shift - a schoolwide embrace of an "ethic of excellence." A master carpenter as well as a gifted teacher, Berger is guided by a craftsman's passion for quality, describing what's possible when teachers, students, and parents commit to nothing less than the best. But Berger's not just idealistic, he's realistic - he tells exactly how this can be done, from the blackboard to the blacktop to the school boardroom.	The Big Picture: Education Is Everyone's BusinessDesigned to re-energize educators and inspire teachers, this moving account of what is possible in education draws examples from a diverse high school in Providence, Rhode Island, with the highest rates of attendance and college acceptance in the state.	1737	3601	482	642	1350	114842	180101	35553	71	274
The Scottish Prisoner (Lord John Grey, #3)Includes a preview of the new novel in the Outlander series. London, 1760. For Jamie Fraser, paroled prisoner-of-war in the remote Lake District, life could be worse: He's not cutting sugar cane in the West Indies, and he's close enough to the son he cannot claim as his own. But Jamie Fraser's quiet existence is coming apart at the seams, interrupted first by dreams of his lost wife, then by the appearance of Tobias Quinn, an erstwhile comrade from the Rising. Like many of the Jacobites who aren't dead or in prison, Quinn still lives and breathes for the Cause. His latest plan involves an ancient relic that will rally the Irish. Jamie is having none of it--he's sworn off politics, fighting, and war. Until Lord John Grey shows up with a summons that will take him away from everything he loves--again. Lord John Grey--aristocrat, soldier, and occasional spy--finds himself in possession of a packet of explosive documents that exposes a damning case of corruption against a British officer. But they also hint at a more insidious danger. Time is of the essence as the investigation leads to Ireland, with a baffling message left in "Erse," the tongue favored by Scottish Highlanders. Lord John, who oversaw Jacobite prisoners when he was governor of Ardsmiur prison, thinks Jamie may be able to translate--but will he agree to do it? Soon Lord John and Jamie are unwilling companions on the road to Ireland, a country whose dark castles hold dreadful secrets, and whose bogs hide the bones of the dead. A captivating return to the world Diana Gabaldon created in her Outlander and Lord John series, The Scottish Prisoneris another masterpiece of epic history, wicked deceit, and scores that can only be settled in blood. From the Hardcover edition.

The year is 1396. King Richard II is childless, the succession to the English throne is in doubt. When the rebellious Henry of Lancaster returns from exile in France in a bid to claim the throne, Constance of York is threatened on all sides. Closely related to both the King and Henry of Lancaster, she is drawn into intrigues as her husband and her brother jostle with their Lancastrian and Mortimer cousins in the race for supremacy.	The ConquestThe year is 1066 and the world is about to change. Suddenly life in England is going to be completely different, especially for Ailith, a young Saxon wife. It is the year in which she loses both her husband and young son, and the year in which the Normans come, not as friends, but in search of conquest. Ailith's grief and despair run so deep that she would have done away with herself and joined her husband and son if a handsome, womanizing Norman, Rolf de Brize, had not happened by in the nick of time. Feeling strangely responsible for the woman whose life he has saved, the normally unreliable Rolf installs Ailith as chatelaine of Ulverton, his English estate. Despite his wife and daughter in France, he and Ailith eventually fall in love and have a daughter, Julitta. But can love truly conquer all - even Rolf's wife's decision to take her rightful place as mistress of Ulverton, and Ailith's discovery of a betrayal at the Battle of Hastings that she can never forgive?	The Seventh SonThe greatest prize and the most deadly - the crown of England Reay Tannahill's enthralling novel is a family saga in the grand tradition, a tale of brother against brother, cousin against cousin, of love, hate and intrigue, of women inescapably entangled in the fates of their men, and of a mystery that has exercised people's minds for more than five hundred years. At the heart of it all is the complex human being known to history as Richard III, a king whose reign is darkened by the murder of the young Princes in the Tower, but who also found a touching love with the woman he married, and possessed immense courage. Here, brought vividly to life in this most moving novel, is a man who inspired loyalty and hatred in almost equal measure, until at last the implacable enmity of one woman brought about his downfall.			1809	6526	827	5634	1372	58957	-1	-1	71	-1

The Eighth Day of the WeekIn the period following Stalin's death in 1953, Marek Hlasko was the most acclaimed and popular contemporary writer in Poland. The Eighth Day of the Week, his first novel, caused a sensation in Poland in 1956 and then in the West, where Hlasko was hailed as "a Communist James Dean." Two young people search for a place to consummate their relationship in a world jammed with strangers and emptied of all intimacy. Their yearning for the redemptive power of authentic love is thwarted by the moral and aesthetic ugliness around them. The Eighth Day of the Weekmemorably depicts the tension between the degradation to which the characters are forced to submit and the preservation of an inner purity which they refuse to relinquish.	ChłopiEach of the four parts represents a season in the life of the peasants -- Autumn (published in 1904), Winter (published in 1904), Spring (published in 1906), and Summer (published in 1909). This division underlines the relationship of human life with nature. Reymont decided to write about peasant life because of historical events, which took place in Polish villages in the early 20th century. The fact that the author was brought up in a village has a significant influence on the novel's plot. In Chlopi, Reymont created a more complete and suggestive picture of country life than any other Polish writer. The novel impresses the reader with its authenticity of the material reality, customs, behaviour and spiritual culture of the people. The composition of the novel astonishes the reader with its strict simplicity and functionality. The titles of the various volumes signal a tetralogy in one vegetational cycle, which regulates the eternal and repeatable rhythm of village life. Parallel to that rhythm is a calendar of religion and customs, also repeatable. In such boundaries Reymont placed a colourful country community with sharply drawn individual portraits. The repertoire of human experience and the richness of spiritual life, which can be compared with the repertoire of Biblical books and Greek myths, has no doctrinal ideas or didactic exemplifications. The author of Chlopi does not believe in doctrines, but rather in his own knowledge of life, the mentality of the people described, and his sense of reality.	I Burn Paris"This is a superb text of astonishing modernity, a veritable manifesto of the wretched of the earth ..." -- Marianne Bruno Jasienski's I Burn Parishas remained one of Poland's most uncomfortable masterstrokes of literature since its initial and controversial serialization in 1928 in the French magazine L'Humanite(for which Jasienski was deported). It tells the story of a disgruntled factory worker who, finding himself on the streets, takes the opportunity to poison Paris's water supply with a deadly virus. With the deaths piling up, we encounter Chinese communists, rabbis, disillusioned scientists, American millionaires and a host of others as the city sections off into ethnic enclaves and everyone plots their route of escape. At the heart of the cosmopolitan city is a deep-rooted xenophobia and hatred -- the one thread that binds all these groups together. As Paris lies in ruin, Jasienski issues a rallying cry to the downtrodden of the world while mixing "The Internationale" with a broadcast of popular music. With its montage strategies reminiscent of early avant-garde cinema and fist-to-the-gut metaphors, I Burn Parishas lost none of its vitality and vigor. Ruthlessly dissecting various utopian fantasies, Jasienski is out to disorient, and he has a seemingly limitless ability to transform the Parisian landscape into the product of disease-addled minds. An exquisite example of literary Futurism and Catastrophism, the novel presents a filthy, degenerated world where factories and machines have replaced the human, but rather than cliche and simplistic propaganda, these features are given an immediacy that depicts the modern metropolis as only superficially cosmopolitan, as hostile and animalistic to its core.	A Minor ApocalypseAs in his novel The Polish Complex, Konwicki's A Minor Apocalypsestars a narrator and character named Konwicki, who has been asked to set himself on fire that evening in front of the Communist Party headquarters in Warsaw in an act of protest. He accepts the commission, but without any clear idea of whether he will actually go through with the self-immolation. He spends the rest of the day wandering the streets of Warsaw, being tortured by the secret police and falling in love. Both himself and Everyman, the character-author experiences the effects of ideologies and bureaucracies gone insane with, as always in history, the individual struggling for survival rather than offering himself up on the pyre of the greater good. Brilliantly translated by Richard Lourie, A Minor Apocalypseis one of the most important novels to emerge from Poland in the last twenty five years.	DiaryJust before the outbreak of World War II, young Witold Gombrowicz left his home in Poland and set sail for South America. In 1953, still living as an expatriate in Argentina, he began his Diary with one of literature's most memorable openings: Monday - Me; Tuesday - Me; Wednesday - Me; and, Thursday - Me. Gombrowicz's Diary grew to become a vast collection of essays, short notes, polemics, and confessions on myriad subjects ranging from political events to literature to the certainty of death. Not a traditional journal, Diary is instead the commentary of a brilliant and restless mind. Widely regarded as a masterpiece, this brilliant work compelled Gombrowicz's attention for a decade and a half until he penned his final entry in France, shortly before his death in 1969. Long out of print in English, Diary is now presented in a convenient single volume featuring a new preface by Rita Gombrowicz, the author's widow and literary executor. This edition also includes ten previously unpublished pages from the 1969 portion of the diary.	4891	509	683	4387	4380	130768	18549	45161	46	158\$\$House of Day, House of NightThe English translation of the prize-winning international bestseller Winner of the Gunter Grass Prize Nowa Ruda is a small town in Silesia, an area that has been a part of Poland, Germany, and the former Czechoslovakia in the past. When the narrator moves into the area, she discovers everyone--and everything--has a story. With the help of Marta, her enigmatic neighbor, the narrator accumulates these stories, tracing the history of Nowa Ruda from the its founding to the lives of its saints, from the caller who wins the radio quiz every day to the man who causes international tension when he dies straddling the border between Poland and Czechoslovakia. Each of the stories represents a brick and they interlock to reveal the immense monument that is the town. What emerges is the message that the history of any place--no matter how humble--is limitless, that by describing or digging at the roots of a life, a house, or a neighborhood, one can see all the connections, not only with one's self and one's dreams but also with all of the universe. Richly imagined, weaving anecdote with recipes and gossip, Tokarczuk's novel is an epic of a small place. Since its publication in 1998 it has remained a bestseller in Poland. House of Day, House of Nightis the English-language debut of one of Europe's best young writers.

The Beautiful Mrs. SeidenmanIn the Nazi-occupied Warsaw of 1943, Irma Seidenman, a young Jewish widow, possesses two attributes that can spell the difference between life and death: she has blue eyes and blond hair. With these, and a set of false papers, she has slipped out of the ghetto, passing as the wife of a Polish officer, until one day an informer spots her on the street and drags her off to the Gestapo. At times a dark lament, at others a sly and sardonic thriller, The Beautiful Mrs. Seidenman is the story of the thirty-six hours that follow Irma's arrest and the events that lead to her dramatic rescue as the last of Warsaw's Jews are about to meet their deaths in the burning ghetto.	MadameThe comic "sentimental education" of a schoolboy who falls in love with his French teacher. Madame is an unexpected gem: a novel about Poland during the grim years of Soviet-controlled mediocrity, which nonetheless sparkles with light and warmth. Our young narrator-hero is suffering through the regulated boredom of high school when he is transfixed by a new teacher --an elegant "older woman" (she is thirty-two) who bewitches him with her glacial beauty and her strict intelligence. He resolves to learn everything he can about her and to win her heart. In a sequence of marvelously funny but sobering maneuvers, he learns much more than he expected to--about politics, Poland, the Spanish Civil War, and his own passion for theater and art--all while his loved one continues to elude him. Yet without his realizing it, his efforts--largely bookish and literary--to close in on Madame are his first steps to liberation as an artist. Later, during a stint as a teacher-in-training in his old school, he discovers that he himself has become a legendary figure to a new generation of students, and he begins to understand the deceits and blessings of myth, and its redemptive power. A winning portrait of an artist as a young man, Madame is at the same time a moving, engaging novel about strength and weakness, first love, and the efforts we make to reconcile, in art, the opposing forces of reason and passion.

An AutobiographyAgatha Christie's 'most absorbing mystery' - her own autobiography, with new exclusive CD containing newly discovered priceless recordings of Agatha dictating excerpts from more than 40 years ago. Over the three decades since her death on 12 January 1976, many of Agatha Christie's readers and reviewers have maintained that her most compelling book is probably still her least well-known. Her candid Autobiography, written mainly in the 1960s, modestly ignores the fact that Agatha had become the best-selling novelist in history and concentrates on her fascinating private life. From early childhood at the end of the 19th century, through two marriages and two World Wars, and her experiences both as a writer and on archaeological expeditions with her second husband, Max Mallowan, Agatha shares the details of her varied and sometimes complex life with real passion and openness. Then, in 2008, Agatha Christie's grandson made a remarkable discovery. While clearing out her old house in preparation for its opening to the public, Greenway in Devon, a box of old tape reels was found to contain the recordings of Agatha dictating her Autobiography for her typist. These remarkable recordings are not only an amazingly rare example of Agatha's voice, but they also partly explain the engaging nature of her Autobiography - for they reveal the normally reclusive Agatha telling her own story in a lively, spontaneous and often conspiratorial way, whose passion in talking about her life is captured in the printed Autobiography. Now this new edition comes complete with a CD of highlights from these priceless tapes, giving Agatha Christie's millions of fans the opportunity to hear the Queen of Crime's story in her own words, and rediscover her remarkable full story in this special edition of her book, which is newly introduced by Mathew Prichard, the grandson who discovered the tapes.	Madame de StäelIn her lifetime it was widely said that there were three political powers in Europe--Britain, Russia, and Madame de Stael. Byron described her as "the first female writer of this, perhaps of any age," Germaine de Stael was certainly the most remarkable woman of her time and she remains unique--both for the scope of her artistic and intellectual achievements, and the force of her political influence which helped to bring down Napoleon. Born in Paris in 1766, the daughter of Jacques Necker, Louis XVI's influential and reforming finance minister, Germaine de Stael was brought up in her mother's salon, amidst the philosophers of the French Enlightenment. A prodigious and disciplined intellect, a need for love and a love of liberty, together with remarkable courage in both public and private life, de Stael was driven to disregard dangers and conventions alike, often at great cost.	A Ticket to the Circus: A MemoirA great American love story, this warm, funny, revealing memoir introduces the world to Norman Mailer's greatest inspiration, his wife of more than thirty years. Like Zelda Fitzgerald before her, Norris Church Mailer has led a life as large and as colorful as her husband's--and every bit as engaging. Growing up a strict Free Will Baptist in the South of the 1950s, Norris Church, christened Barbara Jean Davis, was crowned "Little Miss Little Rock" at the age of three and always knew that life had more to offer her than the comforts of small-town Arkansas. But she could never have guessed that in her early twenties she would date future president Bill Clinton (and predict his national victory even after he lost his first run for Congress), or that the following year she would meet Norman Mailer, who was passing through town giving a lecture at the local college. They fell in love in one night--and their marriage lasted thirty-three years. Despite her enduring love for the man, Norris found life with the writer full of challenges--from carving out her own niche in the wake of five ex-wives and numerous former girlfriends, to easing her way into the hearts of her seven stepchildren, to negotiating the ferocious world of Mailer's fame, friends, and literary life. The couple's New York parties were legendary, and their social circle included such luminaries as Muhammad Ali, Jacqueline Kennedy, Truman Capote, Gore Vidal, and Imelda Marcos. Their decades-long obsession with each other, as seen in the intimate letters that Norris reveals here for the first time, was not without tests and infidelities; theirs was a marriage full of friendship, betrayal, doubts, understanding, and deep, complicated, lifelong passion. With southern charm and wit, Norris Church Mailer depicts the full evolution of her life, from her childhood all the way through her intense marriage with Norman and his heartbreaking death. This unforgettable memoir will enchant readers with its honesty and insight into how we grow up and how we love.	Agatha ChristieBiography of great crime writer is detection job itself. Growing up in Edwardian era, what were her relationships - two husbands and daughter? What mysteries still surround her life - disappearance in 1926? What do six novels under alias Mary Westmacott reveal about her? Based on her letters, papers, notebooks, relative interviews. Works, endnotes, index, 60 photos.	Agatha Christie and the Eleven Missing DaysIn December 1926 Agatha Christie became front-page news when she vanished in bizarre circumstances from her home in Berkshire, England. The crime writer was found 11 days later in a hotel in Harrogate,Yorkshire, claiming to be the victim of amnesia. Up till now none of her biographers has come up with conclusive evidence as to what Agatha Christie did in the first 24 hours after she disappeared or whether her memory loss was genuine. Although the notoriety made Agatha Christie famous, she never recovered from the intense press scrutiny, and the private anguish that surrounded the episode ensured that she made no reference to it in her memoirs. Illustrated with many hitherto unpublished photographs, Jared Cade's riveting book--on which a BBC television documentary has been based--provides all the answers, including startling accounts by the novelist's surviving relatives, that reveal for the first time why she staged the disappearance with the help of a co-conspiritor and how it all went terribly wrong.	The Gates of November"REMARKABLE . . . A WONDERFUL STORY." --The Boston Globe The father is a high-ranking Communist officer, a Jew who survived Stalin's purges. The son is a "refusenik," who risked his life and happiness to protest everything his father held dear. Now, Chaim Potok, beloved author of the award-winning novels The Chosen and My Name is Asher Lev, unfolds the gripping true story of a father, a son, and a conflict that spans Soviet history. Drawing on taped interviews and his harrowing visits to Russia, Potok traces the public and privates lives of the Slepak family: Their passions and ideologies, their struggles to reconcile their identities as Russians and as Jews, their willingness to fight--and die--for diametrically opposed political beliefs. "[A] vivid account . . . [Potok] brings a novelist's passion and eye for detail to a gripping story that possesses many of the elements of fiction--except that it's all too true." --San Francisco Chronicle	2896	5943	910	5575	1354	158910	-1	57337	71	158\$\$Tommy's Honor: The Story of Old Tom Morris and Young Tom Morris, Golf's Founding Father and Son	We Were Young and Carefree: The Autobiography of Laurent FignonThe international bestselling autobiography of twice-Tour-de-France-winner Laurent Fignon, one of the greatest and most charismatic cyclists of all time. 'One of the most charismatic and flamboyant cyclists in recent history' Daily Telegraph  Laurent Fignon is one of the giants of modern cycling. Twice-winner of the Tour de France in the early eighties, Fignon became the star for a new generation. In 1989 he took part in one of the most fiercely-contested Tours of all time. Over the course of 3,285 kilometres he lost out to his American arch-rival, Greg LeMond, by an agonising eight seconds on the final Parisian time trial. In this forthright and unflinching account the former champion spares neither friends nor opponents, nor even himself. In doing so he gives cycling fans a tantalising glimpse of what really went on behind the scenes of this epic sport - the friendships, the rivalries, the betrayals, the scheming, the parties, the girls, and, of course, the performance-enhancing drugs. Laurent Fignon lived cycling at its peak. He enjoyed a truly exceptional career, winning over eighty titles from 1982 to 1993. The highs were matched by lows of serious injury, periods of self-doubt, and accusations of cheating. Fignon's story bestrides a golden age in cycling: a time when the headlines spoke of heroes, not doping, and a time when cyclists were afraid of nothing. Laurent Fignonwas born in Paris in 1960. He won the Tour de France in 1983 and 1984 and the Giro d'Italia in 1989. In June 2009, Fignon revealed that he was being treated for advanced intestinal cancer and he died in August 2010.	Jeff Corwin: A Wild Life: The Authorized Biography	White Heat: The Friendship of Emily Dickinson and Thomas Wentworth Higginson	Tears of a Clown: Glenn Beck and the Tea Bagging of AmericaWashington Post columnist Dana Milbank takes a fair and balanced look at the unsettling rise of the silly Fox News host Glenn Beck.  Thomas Jefferson famously wrote that "the tree of Liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants. It is its natural manure." In America in 2010, Glenn Beck provides the very refreshment Jefferson had in mind: Whether he's the patriot or the tyrant, he's definitely full of manure. The wildly popular Fox News host with three million daily viewers perfectly captures the vitriol of our time and the fact-free state of our political culture. The secret to his success is his willingness to traffic in the fringe conspiracies and Internet hearsay that others wouldn't touch with a ten-foot pole: death panels, government health insurance for dogs, FEMA concentration camps, an Obama security force like Hitler's SS. But Beck, who is, according to a recent Gallup poll, admired by more Americans than the Pope, has nothing in his background that identifies him as an ideologue, giving rise to the speculation that his right-wing shtick is just that--the act of a brilliant showman, known for both his over-the-top daily outrages and for weeping on the air. Milbank describes, with lacerating wit, just how the former shock jock without a college degree has managed to become the most recognizable leader of antigovernment conservatives and exposes him as the guy who is single-handedly giving patriotism a bad name.	The Match: The Day the Game of Golf Changed ForeverThe year: 1956. Four decades have passed since Eddie Lowery came to fame as the ten-year-old caddie to U.S. Open Champion Francis Ouimet. Now a wealthy car dealer and avid supporter of amateur golf, Lowery has just made a bet with fellow millionaire George Coleman. Lowery claims that two of his employees, amateur golfers Harvie Ward and Ken Venturi, cannot be beaten in a best-ball match. Lowery challenges Coleman to bring any two golfers of his choice to the course at 10 a.m. the next day to settle the issue. Coleman accepts the challenge and shows up with his own power team: Ben Hogan and Byron Nelson, the game's greatest living professionals, with fourteen major championships between them. In Mark Frost's peerless hands, complete with the recollections of all the participants, the story of this immortal foursome and the game they played that day--legendarily known in golf circles as the greatest private match ever played--comes to life with powerful, emotional impact and edge-of-your-seat suspense.	1684	2896	3990	6449	845	68843	-1	-1	-1	-1

John Copsale, the Regent of Sparrow Hall, has been found dead in his bed and it is being whispered that he was murdered by the mysterious 'Bell Man'. Then the college librarian and activist, Robert Ascham is discovered with a crossbow bolt in his chest. King Edward, hearing of the seething unrest in Oxford, arrives unannounced at Sir Hugh Corbett's country manor, and insists that Corbett go to the city to solve the murderous mysteries. And when the King commands, few can resist even if it means knowingly entering a dangerous and violent world...	The Prince of Darkness (Hugh Corbett, #5)It is 1301 and a fragile peace exists between Edward of England and Philip IV of France. In the fetid alleys and slums of London and Paris it is a different matter. Here the secret agents of both countries still fight their own, silent, deadly battles. The Prince of Wales wallows in luxury under the sinister influence of his favourite, Gaveston, who has secret political ambitions to dominate the young prince and the English crown. These scandals are threatened with exposure when Lady Belmont, the prince's former mistress, is found dead, her neck broken, at the foot of a nunnery's steps. Was it suicide? An accident? Or malicious murder? Edward turns to his master spy, Hugh Corbett, to solve the mystery. In doing so, Corbett must face the deadly rivalry of his French counterpart, the murderous rage of Gaveston and the silent threats of assassins. He must also contend with the lies and silken deceits of his own master.	1809	2949	1211	4601	5487	193388	-1	18938	5	274
Sokkeloportaikko"Peter naki ymparillaan pelkkia portaita. Korkeuksissa sijaitseva lepotaso, jolla han seisoi, naytti olevan ainoa tasainen paikka. Yla- ja alapuolella nakyi porrassyoksyja niin laajalti kuin saattoi erottaa. Kaiteita ei ollut. Portaat nousivat ja laskivat, kaantyivat jyrkasti, haarautuivat, yhtyivat vaarallisiksi kierteiksi, ylittivat ja alittivat toisensa. Ne eivat olleet ulkotilassa, mutta Peter ei pystynyt erottamaan seinia, kattoa tai lattiaa. Han naki pelkkia portaita. Miksi hanet oli tuotu tanne?" Kammottavasta, suljetusta sokkeloportaikosta loytyy nelja muutakin nuorta. Kestaa kuitenkin kauan ennen kuin heille alkaa paljastua, miksi heidat on eristetty tahan epainhimilliseen rakennukseen. Ja kun se selviaa, alkaa armoton kamppailu, jossa hyva ja paha kayvat taistelua ihmisen sisimmasta.	Black HelicoptersA teenage girl. A survivalist childhood. And now a bomb strapped to her chest. See the world through her eyes in this harrowing and deeply affecting literary thriller. I'm Valkyrie White. I'm fifteen. Your government killed my family. Ever since Mabby died while picking beans in their garden -- with the pock-a-pock of a helicopter overhead -- four-year-old Valley knows what her job is: hide in the underground den with her brother, Bo, while Da is working, because Those People will kill them like coyotes. But now, with Da unexpectedly gone and no home to return to, a teenage Valley (now Valkyrie) and her big brother must bring their message to the outside world -- a not-so-smart place where little boys wear their names on their backpacks and young men don't pat down strangers before offering a lift. Blythe Woolston infuses her white-knuckle narrative, set in a day-after-tomorrow Montana, with a dark, trenchant humor and a keen psychological eye. Alternating past-present vignettes in prose as tightly wound as the springs of a clock and as masterfully plotted as a game of chess, she ratchets up the pacing right to the final, explosive end.	Saturday, the Twelfth of OctoberAfter spending almost a year with cave people from an earlier time, a young girl is transported back to the present greatly changed, both by her experience and by the fact that no one believes her.	FadeIT IS THE summer of 1938 when young Paul Moreaux discovers he can "fade." First bewildered, then thrilled with the power of invisibility, Paul experiments. But his "gift" soon shows him shocking secrets and drives him toward a chilling act. "Imagine what might happen if Holden Caufield stepped into H. G. Wells' The Invisible Man, and you'll have an idea how good Fadeis. . . . I was absolutely riveted."--Stephen King	Murder Genes	Invitation to the GameA chilling account of life in 2154, when most jobs are done by machines. Lisse and her friends are unemployable after graduation, but the government gives them an abandoned warehouse in a bleak neighborhood to live in. Anxious to escape their dreary lives, the friends embrace The Game, which takes them to paradise. But is this world real or only a computer simulation?	3227	605	5600	2412	432	115196	-1	24355	108	158\$\$Z for ZachariahA gripping, thought-provoking story about life after a nuclear holocaust, by a Newbery Medalist. Ann Burden is sixteen years old and completely alone. The world as she once knew it is gone, ravaged by a nuclear war that has taken everyone from her. For the past year, she has lived in a remote valley with no evidence of any other survivors. But the smoke from a distant campfire shatters Ann's solitude. Someone else is still alive and making his way toward the valley. Who is this man? What does he want? Can he be trusted? Both excited and terrified, Ann soon realizes there may be worse things than being the last person on Earth.	Brother in the LandDenny, a teenager, is one of the unlucky ones, a survivor, one of those who have come through a nuclear war alive. In plain language he sets down all that has happened to him, what he sees, and what he feels in the first days after the bomb has dropped. This novel won The Other Award for 1984.	The Wild Shore (Three Californias Triptych, #1)2047: For the small Pacific Coast community of San Onofre, life in the aftermath of a devastating nuclear attack is a matter of survival, a day-to-day struggle to stay alive. But young Hank Fletcher dreams of the world that might have been, and might yet be--and dreams of playing a crucial role in America's rebirth.	WardayThe unthinkable happened five years ago. Now two writers have set out to find what's left of America. New York, Washington DC, San Antonio, & parts of the Central & Western states are gone. Famine, epidemics, border wars & radiation diseases have devastated the countryside in between. It was a 'limited' nuclear war, just a 36-minute exchange of missiles that abruptly ended when the superpowers' communication systems broke down. But Warday destroyed much of civilization. Whitley Strieber & James Kunetka, old friends, take a dangerous odyssey across the former USA, sometimes hopeful that a new, peaceful world can be built over the old, sometimes despairing over the immense losses & embittered people they meet. In an eerie blend of fact & imagination, Strieber (author of The Wolfen & The Hunger) & Kunetka (author of City of Fire: Los Alamos & The Atomic Age, 1943-1945 & Oppenheimer: The Years of Risk) cut thru the doublespeak of military bureaucracy & the rhetoric of the 1980's peace movement to portray America after Warday.	The City, Not Long After	The Kindling (Fire-us, #1)It is the year 2007. The world has been wiped out by a deadly plague that killed all the adults. Without them, children perished of hunger and disease. No more people, no more electricity, no more civilization -- just mildewed houses, overgrown yards, and abandoned cars. Yet on a highway strip outside a small town in Florida, the words "We're Still Here" are painted in letters big enough to be seen from an airplane -- although no planes ever cross the empty sky. Miraculously, seven children have survived among the ruins. They cannot remember their names, their families, or much else from the Before Time. But they have forged a new family, with new names: Mommy, Hunter, Teacher, Action Figure, Teddy Bear, Baby, and Doll. They must face each day with enough hope to endure and the strength to realize that there may be nothing out there worth living for. Then one day, a new kid shows up on their doorstep and changes everything. He invites them to join him on a dangerous journey to Washington, to find a man called President if he's still alive -- and seek the answers to the mystery at the heart of the Fire-us. In this first book of the Fire-us Trilogy, Jennifer Armstrong and Nancy Butcher weave a compelling post-apocalyptic tale, luring readers into a world that is inventive enough to intrigue, yet true enough to believe.	5263	3227	605	2663	5586	80470	-1	36194	71	158
Selected StoriesO. Henry originated the humorous, energetic tale that ends with an ironic, even shocking twist. In "After Twenty Years," for example, two boys agree to meet at a particular spot exactly twenty years later. Both are faithful, but in the intervening years one boy has turned into a criminal, the other into a policeman. Behind the rendezvous lurks a powerful dramatic situation with a fascinating moral dilemma--all in a few brief pages. This is just one of the many literary gems in Selected Stories of O. Henry, a collection of forty-five of O. Henry's most renowned and entertaining short stories. Each one offers insights into human nature and the ways it is affected by love, jealousy, poverty, gentility, and the all-pervading reality of people conning people--themes that ran through the author's own life. Born William Sidney Porter, O. Henry started writing while in prison for embezzlement. Later he moved to New York, and his tales romanticizing the commonplace, particularly the life of ordinary New Yorkers, became highly popular. The most widely read author of his time, O. Henry died penniless but left behind a wealth of short stories that endure as hallmarks of the genre.	Daisy Miller and Washington SquareIn Henry James''s "Daisy Miller, a young American woman ventures into sophisticated European society, where her naivete provokes scandal and tragedy. Graham Greene called "Washington Square "the only novel in which a man has successfully invaded the feminine field and produced work comparable to Jane Austen''s." Each work weaves an intricate tale of marriage, money, and manners.	Ethan Frome and Other Short Fiction	Essays and Poems	Common Sense and Other WritingsIntroduction and Notes by Joyce Appleby Though he didn't emigrate from England to the colonies until 1774, just a few months before the Revolutionary War began, Thomas Paine had an enormous impact on that war & the new nation that emerged from it. Common Sense, the instantly popular pamphlet he published in January 1776, argued that the goal of the struggle against the British should be not simply tax reform, as many were calling for, but complete independence. His rousing, radical voice was balanced by the equally independence-minded but more measured tones of Thomas Jefferson, who wrote the Declaration of Independence later that year. In later works, such as The Rights of Man, The Age of Reason, & other selections included in this volume, he proved himself a visionary moralist centuries ahead of his time. He believed that every human has the natural right to life's necessities & that government's role should be to provide for those in dire need. An impassioned opponent of all forms of slavery, he understood that no one in poverty is truly free--a lesson still to be learned by many of our leaders today.	Back in the WorldTo American soldiers in Vietnam, "back in the world" meant America and safety. To Tobias Wolff's characters, Back in the Worldis where lives that have veered out of control just might become normal again. Unfortunately, the men and women in these gripping, pungent, and wonderfully skewed stories have only the vaguest notion of what normal is. A gentle priest finds himself in a Vegas hotel with a hysterical, sun-burned stranger. A show-biz hopeful undergoes a dubious audition in a hearse speeding across the California desert. An aging soldier is distracted from a night of philandering by a gun-toting neighbor and a suicidal enlisted man. As he moves among these unfortunates, Wolff observes the disparity between their realities and their dreams, in ten stories of exhilarating lucidity and grace. Stories included are: "The Missing Person," "Say Yes," "The Poor Are Always With Us," "Sister," "Soldier's Joy," "Desert Breakdown," "Our Story Begins," "Leviathan," and "The Rich Brother." "Terrific...The magic of his fiction cannot be explained. It is the ancient art of the master storyteller."--Tim O'Brien	2816	832	986	4404	951	178625	39571	23267	-1	274\$\$Silas Marner and Two Short Stories (Barnes  Noble Classics Series)George Eliot's third novel, Silas Marner(1861) is a powerful and moving tale about one man's journey from exile and loneliness to the warmth and joy of the family. The story opens as Silas Marner, falsely accused of theft, loses everything, including his faith in God. Embittered and alienated from his fellow man, he moves to the village of Raveloe, where he becomes a weaver. Taking refuge in his work, Silas slowly begins to accumulate gold--his only joy in life--until one day that too is stolen from him. Then one dark evening, a beautiful, golden-haired child, lost and seeing the light from Silas's cottage, toddles in through his doorway. As Silas grows to love the girl as if she were his own daughter, his life changes into something precious. But his happiness is threatened when the orphan's real father comes to claim the girl as his own, and Silas must face losing a treasure greater than all the gold in the world. This volume also includes two shorter works by Eliot--The Lifted Veil, a dark Gothic fantasy about a morbid young clairvoyant, and Brother Jacob, a deliciously satirical fable about a confectioner's apprentice.	The Mother's RecompenseOpening on the French Riviera among a motley community of American expatriates, The Mother's Recompensetells the story of Kate Clephane and her reluctant return to New York society after being exiled years before for abandoning her husband and infant daughter. Oddly enough, Kate has been summoned back by that same daughter, Anne, now fully grown and intent on marrying Chris Fenno, a war hero, dilettante, and social opportunist. Chris's questionable intentions toward her daughter are, however, the least of Kate's worries since she was once, and still is, deeply in love with him. Kate's moral quandary and the ensuing drama evoke comparison with Oedipus and Hamlet and lead to an ending that startled the mores of the day.	Great American Short Stories: From Hawthorne to HemingwayBeginning with well-known stories by Hawthorne, Melville, and Poe, this diverse and colorful collection includes tales by Mark Twain, Ambrose Bierce, Sherwood Anderson, Henry James, Edith Wharton, Willa Cather, Stephen Crane, and Mary Wilkins Freeman. From Sarah Orne Jewett's portraits of rural Maine to F. Scott Fitzgerald's brilliant tales from the Jazz Age, these stories span the breadth of the American experience. In addition to acknowledged masters of the short story form, such as O. Henry, Jack London, and Ernest Hemingway, this volume features stories by Charles W. Chesnutt, the first important African-American novelist, and Charlotte Perkins Gilman, a leading theorist of the early women's movement.	The Rhetoric & The Poetics of AristotleTranslated by Rhys Roberts and Ingram Bywater, Introduction by Edward P.J. Corbett	Notes from Underground, The Double and Other StoriesNotes from Underground, The Double and Other Stories, by Fyodor Dostoevsky, is part of the Barnes & Noble Classicsseries, which offers quality editions at affordable prices to the student and the general reader, including new scholarship, thoughtful design, and pages of carefully crafted extras. Here are some of the remarkable features of Barnes & Noble Classics: New introductions commissioned from today's top writers and scholars Biographies of the authors Chronologies of contemporary historical, biographical, and cultural events Footnotes and endnotes Selective discussions of imitations, parodies, poems, books, plays, paintings, operas, statuary, and films inspired by the work Comments by other famous authors Study questions to challenge the reader's viewpoints and expectations Bibliographies for further reading Indices & Glossaries, when appropriate All editions are beautifully designed and are printed to superior specifications; some include illustrations of historical interest. Barnes & Noble Classics pulls together a constellation of influences--biographical, historical, and literary--to enrich each reader's understanding of these enduring works. Often considered a prologue to Dostoevsky's brilliant novels, the story "Notes from Underground" introduces one of the great anti-heroes in literature: the underground man, who lives on the fringes of society. In an impassioned, manic monologue this character--plagued by shame, guilt, and alienation--argues that reason is merely a flimsy construction built upon humanity's essentially irrational core. Internal conflict is also explored in "The Double," a surreal tale of a government clerk who meets a more unpleasant version of himself and is changed as a result. In addition to these two existential classics, this collection also includes the psychologically probing stories "The Meek One," "The Dream of a Ridiculous Man," and "White Nights." Deborah A.

More specifically she cuts herself to numb emotions. In a series of raw journal entries, the confused teenager writes to her estranged father, filling him in on what's happened in her life since he left her nearly 18 years ago. Throughout the course of her letter writing, Charity chronicles her penchant for cutting, a serious struggle with depression and her inability to vocally express her feelings.	The Luckiest Girl in the WorldJust looking at Katie Roskova, you'd think she had it all: she was pretty, popular, an A-student at an exclusive private school, and on her way to becoming a champion figure skater. But there was another Katie, the one she hid from the world, who was having trouble dealing with the mounting pressures of her young life. And it was this Katie who, with no other means of expression available to her, reacted to her overbearing mother, her absent father, her unforgiving schedule, and her oblivious classmates by turning her self-doubt into self-hatred. And into self-mutilation. In his previous novel, The Best Little Girl in the World, Steven Levenkron brought insight, expertise, and sensitivity to the painful subject of anorexia nervosa. Now he applies these same talents to demystifying a condition that is just as heartbreaking, and becoming more common everyday. Through his depiction of Katie's self-mutilating behavior - she is called "a cutter" by her peers - and her triumphant road to recovery, he offers a compelling profile of a young girl in trouble, and much-needed hope to the growing numbers who suffer from this shocking syndrome.	BreakJonah is on a mission to break every bone in his body. Everyone knows that broken bones grow back stronger than they were before.

Breaking, and then healing, is Jonah's only way to cope with the stresses of home, girls, and the world on his shoulders.  When Jonah's self-destructive spiral accelerates and he hits rock bottom, will he find true strength or surrender to his breaking point?	The Perfect CutAfter the death of his tough, guitar-playing, much-loved sister, Michelle, Brian finds it increasingly difficult to care about anything. He doesn't care about his parents. He doesn't care about his friends. He doesn't care about school. He just doesn't care anymore. The only time Brian comes alive is in the few seconds it takes for the razor to slice through his skin. But he never cuts deep enough to cause any real damage. At least, not yet... In The Perfect Cut,Julie Burtinshaw has written an incredibly honest and perceptive novel about cutting, revealing why this dangerous practice has become an increasingly common form of stress relief among young adults. Told from the perspective of the grief-stricken Brian who, in his mind, has run out of options for coping, it's clear that while he makes some bad choices, he's not a bad person. The book ends on a grace note, reassuring young readers that even terrible obstacles can be overcome, and that where there's life, there is hope.	Lady InjuryFollow the true story of my struggle with self-injury, bulimia, and my own mind. Constant anxiety and an abusive past brought me to intentionally, and repeatedly cut my leg, burn my wrist, and beat my arm with a wrench. I was admitted to a psychiatric ward. My fear of regaining the weight I lost, and losing my violent means of coping, causes me to fight against the help I so desperately needed. I went where all the rules were made for me and I had to obey. People cried out in fits. I've seen them destroy the things in their path. I've heard the staff call for security and, moments later, I'd see the patient get carried away by a dozen strong men. Soon, that patient was tied to a bed in an isolation room. My heart ached for those that got tied down. I had no idea that I would soon become one of them. Let me tell you about how I dealt with the loss of my secrets, and how my family reacted to my need to bleed. Let me introduce you to the unique men and women admitted to the ward alongside me. Let me tell you what all this was like for me. This story has descriptive detail of acts of self-injury. I warn you of triggering content.

O noapte furtunoasăPe 18 ianuarie 1879, Teatrul National din Bucuresti prezinta in premiera O noapte furtunoasa, trecuta in programul teatrului de Ion Ghica, director general al teatrelor. Premiera a avut mare succes, dar autorul, iesit pe scena ca sa primeasca aplauzele furtunoase dezlantuite chiar dupa primul act, s-a auzit fluierat si huiduit de grupuri organizate la galerie. Despre ceea ce se intamplase ne marturiseste chiar Caragiale: ,,Se raspandise vestea ca piesa lovea in institutia Garzii Cetatenesti. Iar la a doua reprezentatie, din 21 februarie, am fost iar fluierat, huiduit si amenintat, de o droaie de patrioti din Garda Civica, cu bataia in piata Teatrului. Niste tineri ofiteri m-au scapat de furia lor." Acesta a fost motivul care a determinat conducerea Teatrului National sa scoata piesa din program. Protestul fusese organizat de un grup de pretinsi moralisti, pentru acordarea unei satisfactii micii burghezii ,,ultragiate" de continutul piesei. Si cu toate acestea, momentul a marcat inceputul gloriei lui Caragiale, toate piesele pe care le-a prezentat mai tarziu constituind cele mai mari succese ale teatrului romanesc de acum doua secole	Poveşti. Povestiri. AmintiriCeea ce uimeste si seduce cu precadere in Amintiri...este puterea privirii de a calatori nestingherit, incoace si-ncolo, in acest univers launtric, fie evocand poznele lui Nica de parca ar fi vazute chiar cu ochii copilului de odinioara, fie alunecand, in treacat, peste melancoliile scriitorului adult. Povestile lui Creanga sunt delectabile deopotriva pentru copii si pentru adulti. Insa numai cei din urma le pot gusta pe deplin savoarea. Creanga pare a nu-si fi batut capul sa inventeze povesti: avea destul material la indemana ca sa mai fie nevoie de asa ceva. Cat datoreaza el creatiei folclorice anonime si cat ii este aceasta tributara dupa publicarea povestilor si absorbtia - sau reintoarcerea - acestora in circuitul oralitatii e o chestiune ce poate interesa migaloase cercetari erudite. Farmecul povestilor lui Creanga nu sta in inventie - cel mult, aici si-a spus cuvantul selectia facuta de scriitor dintr-un inventar disponibil atat de bogat. Ceea ce atrage si cucereste, in primul rand, e ,,punerea in scena" - nemaivorbind de darul rostirii plastice, suculente, atat de mult comentat si analizat.	Fram, ursul polar,,El nu avea nevoie de imblanzitor, de cravasa si de semnale. Intra singur in arena, ca un om. Intra in doua labe, cat era de mare. Saluta in dreapta si in stanga, inainte si indarat. Pe urma facea un semn ca vrea liniste. Si incepea singur programul lui". Fram, ursul polareste povestea unui urs alb, ,,puternic, dar bland si glumet", care isi traieste majoritatea vietii in circ, unde ani buni fusese principala atractie. Totusi dorul de a deveni un urs ca toti ursii, adica salbatic si liber, il duce spre casa, la Polul Nord, acolo unde poate sa se bucure de gheturi, de vanturi, de viscole, de soarele polar sau de aurora boreala..	Legende, sau Basmele Românilor,,A te interesa de aceste basme feerice este un lucru natural; a le feri de nimicirea la care ar fi expuse cu timpul este o dorinta patriotica; insa a sti de a le pastra naivitatea poetica a graiului povestitorilor de la sezatori este o opera din cele mai meritorii. Acest merit l-ai avut d-ta, domnule Ispirescu, si eu te felicit cu toata sinceritatea unui admirator al poeziei poporului nostru pentru modelul iscusit cu care ai cules si ai publicat importanta colectie ce ai intreprins cu multa osteneala si mari sacrificii."

Moromeții I (Moromeții, #1)Originalitatea romanului Morometii sta fara indoiala in noua viziune asupra lumii rurale. Cele doua volume contin povestea unei familii de tarani din Campia Dunarii, mai precis din satul teleormanean Silistea-Gumesti, care cunoaste, de-a lungul unui sfert de secol, o adanca si simbolica destramare. In volumul I satul e infatisat cu cativa ani inaintea celui de-al doilea razboi mondial, in vara anului 1937, intr-o perioada de relativa sau iluzorie stabilitate sociala, perioada in care timpul era foarte rabdator cu oamenii. Spre deosebire de inaintasi, care au vazut satul din Campia Dunarii zbuciumat, angajat in actiuni disperate, Marin Preda descrie, in primul volum din Morometii un sat in care nu se petrec drame zguduitoare, formidabile rasturnari si unde nu clocoteste razvratirea. Traiul populatiei din Silistea-Gumesti nu e usor deloc, decat pentru cateva familii instarite, familiile unora ca alde Aristide, Cotelici, Balosu sau Iocan, dar nici peste masura de amarat nu este. Ii apasa pe multi impozitele, fonciirea si alte neajunsuri dar ele pot fi inca suportate de oameni, care se aduna cu placere duminica, la taifas, in poiana lui Iocan unde citesc ziare, povestesc anecdote, glumesc, angajandu-se in adevarate dueluri ale inteligentei. Silistea-Gumesti este o comuna mare, cu doua biserici, o scoala cu patru sute cincizeci de elevi inscrisi si vreo sapte invatatori. Hotarul comunei cuprinde, loturi mai vaste sau mai restranse ale taranilor si mosia Marica, vegheata cu strasnicie de un paznic. Afara de bogatasii satului, care au case mari, taranii ceilalti vietuiesc in case cu doua sau trei camere si chiar in bordeie. Gospodaria Morometilor pare solida si grija conducatorului ei este s-o mentina intacta. E pentru intaia oara cand in literatura romana taranul nu este stapanit de ideea de a avea pamant, ca sansa a fericirii sale, ci de a si-l pastra.	Poveşti. Povestiri. AmintiriCeea ce uimeste si seduce cu precadere in Amintiri...este puterea privirii de a calatori nestingherit, incoace si-ncolo, in acest univers launtric, fie evocand poznele lui Nica de parca ar fi vazute chiar cu ochii copilului de odinioara, fie alunecand, in treacat, peste melancoliile scriitorului adult. Povestile lui Creanga sunt delectabile deopotriva pentru copii si pentru adulti. Insa numai cei din urma le pot gusta pe deplin savoarea. Creanga pare a nu-si fi batut capul sa inventeze povesti: avea destul material la indemana ca sa mai fie nevoie de asa ceva. Cat datoreaza el creatiei folclorice anonime si cat ii este aceasta tributara dupa publicarea povestilor si absorbtia - sau reintoarcerea - acestora in circuitul oralitatii e o chestiune ce poate interesa migaloase cercetari erudite. Farmecul povestilor lui Creanga nu sta in inventie - cel mult, aici si-a spus cuvantul selectia facuta de scriitor dintr-un inventar disponibil atat de bogat. Ceea ce atrage si cucereste, in primul rand, e ,,punerea in scena" - nemaivorbind de darul rostirii plastice, suculente, atat de mult comentat si analizat.	La Medeleni [vol. 1-3]Volumul I / Hotarul nestatornic Chiar de la intaiul volum, Ulita copilariei, Ionel Teodoreanu apare ca un scriitor original, in posesiunea deplina a formulei sale. Daca, exterior, aceasta literatura lirica si imagistica, traind aproape exclusiv din evocarea varstei infantile, duce, in chip vadit, la Jules Renard, la Anghel si la Delavrancea, ea ramane foarte personala prin tineretea ei, autentica, prin extraordinara memorie a copilariei! intr-un soi de poeme in proza si de insemnari (...) autorul reconstruieste in ton idilic acea varsta a exuberantei pe care adultul o uita de obicei usor... Prin adanca incursiune in sufletul copilaresc, prin atmosfera fericirii si prin prospectiunea receptiei, Ulita copilariei si intaiul volum din La Medeleni sunt opere de valoare durabila si adevaratele infaptuiri ale autorului. G. Calincscu Volumul II / Drumuri Eroii lui Ionel Teodoreanu, mediul, atmosfera, pe alocuri chiar atitudinea scriitorului sunt legate de tra ditie, in povestirile si romanele lui bate dez-mierdator un vant de patriarhalitate. Si cu toate acestea, maniera si limba folosita de el intru redarea acestor realitati specifice romanesti (respectiv moldovenesti) e tot ceea ce poate fi mai personal, mai modern, mai imbibat cu adevarurile invatate de la simbolisti si de la Proust. Mediul patriarhal al Medelenilor e privit prin experienta modernistilor din Franta. Mircea Eliade Volumul III / Intre vanturi ... Alaturi de Arghezi, Ionel Teodoreanu ramane unul dintre stilistii nostri remarcabili, contribuind masiv la imbogatirea limbii literare, la mladierea, la ornarea ei. Ceea ce este valoros, intr-o opera inegala si amenintata de proxilitate sunt paginile consacrate universului candorii infantile si tulburatoarei perioade a adolescentei, cu incertitudinile si cautarile ei febrile; insumate, aceste pagini reprezinta "o foarte serioasa monografie a unui tinut sufletesc, care de azi inainte isi are locul fixat in geografia romanului romanesc". (Perpessicius)	Ultima noapte de dragoste, întâia noapte de război"La aparitie, in 1930, romanul lui Camil Petrescu, Ultima noapte de dragoste, intaia noapte de razboi, a surprins critica prin caracterul lui aparent neunitar. O poveste clasica de dragoste si un jurnal de razboi, greu de legat intre ele. Persoana intai a naratiunii nu parea suficienta pentru a fi citite impreuna. Si mai era ceva, impresia, nu chiar usor de formulat, ca nici gelozia, nici razboiul nu aveau infatisarea cunoscuta din alte romane ale vremii. Ceea ce critica n-avea cum sa stie inca era ca, sub ochii ei, se petrecea o reforma a romanului pe cat de profunda, pe atat de radicala, si ca, in pofida inertiei unui gen devenit foarte popular, romanul nu va mai fi niciodata acelasi dupa Ultima noapte de dragoste, intaia noapte de razboi." - Nicolae Manolescu		1470	2574	2657	5648	2234	137900	-1	35419	71	-1

The Crawleys desperately try to remain dignified while they are shunned by society, but the scandal threatens to tear them, and the community, apart. Drawing on his own childhood experience of genteel poverty, Trollope gives a painstakingly realistic depiction of the trials of a family striving to maintain its standards at all costs. With its sensitive portrayal of the proud and self-destructive figure of Crawley, this final volume is the darkest and most complex of all the Barsetshire novels.	The Tenant of Wildfell HallNote: Editions of The Tenant that start with: "You must go back with me..." are incomplete. Actual opening line of the novel is: "To J. Halford, Esq. Dear Halford, when we were together last..." Gilbert Markham is deeply intrigued by Helen Graham, a beautiful and secretive young widow who has moved into nearby Wildfell Hall with her young son. He is quick to offer Helen his friendship, but when her reclusive behavior becomes the subject of local gossip and speculation, Gilbert begins to wonder whether his trust in her has been misplaced. It is only when she allows Gilbert to read her diary that the truth is revealed and the shocking details of her past. Told with great immediacy, combined with wit and irony, The Tenant of Wildfell Hallis a powerfully involving read. Introduction by Steve Davies.	Mary BartonThis is Elizabeth Gaskell's first novel, a widely acclaimed work based on the actual murder, in 1831, of a progressive mill owner. It follows Mary Barton, daughter of a man implicated in the murder, through her adolescence, when she suffers the advances of the mill owner, and later through love and marriage. Set in Manchester, between 1837-42, it paints a powerful and moving picture of working-class life in Victorian England.	Adam BedeHailed for its sympathetic and accurate rendering of nineteenth-century English pastoral life, Adam Bedewas George Eliot's first full-length novel and a bestseller from the moment of publication. Eliot herself called it "a country story - full of the breath of cows and scent of hay." In the early days of the Napoleonic Wars, Adam Bede is hardworking carpenter with enormous physical strength and considerable force of will. But Adam has a single flaw, his blind love of Hetty Sorrel, a vain, shallow dairymaid who spurns Adam but is easily seduced by the local squire. The bitter and tragic consequences of her actions shake the very foundations of their serene rural community. While Adam Bederepresents a timeless story of seduction and betrayal, it is also a deeper, impassioned meditation on the irrevocable consequences of human actions and on moral growth and redemption through suffering.	The Bride of LammermoorThis is a story of national change and personal tragedy. For Lucy Ashton and Edgar Ravenswood, acts of heroism are thwarted and love is doomed by social, political and historical division. This edition restores the action to the years of uncertainty and political flux before the Union of Scotland and England in 1707, rather than after, as Scott's later revision had placed it.	3924	5648	2990	5481	2582	30120	-1	-1	-1	-1\$\$Bleak HouseBleak House is a novel by Charles Dickens, published in 20 monthly installments between March 1852 and September 1853. It is held to be one of Dickens's finest novels, containing one of the most vast, complex and engaging arrays of minor characters and sub-plots in his entire canon. At the novel's core is long-running litigation in England's Court of Chancery, Jarndyce v Jarndyce, which has far-reaching consequences for all involved. The litigation, which already has taken many years and consumed between PS60,000 and PS70,000 in court costs, is emblematic of the failure of Chancery. Though Chancery lawyers and judges criticised Dickens's portrait of Chancery as exaggerated and unmerited, his novel helped to spur an ongoing movement that culminated in the enactment of legal reform in the 1870s.

No Name'Mr Vanstone's daughters are Nobody's Children'. Magdalen Vanstone and her sister Norah learn the true meaning of social stigma in Victorian England only after the traumatic discovery that their dearly loved parents, whose sudden deaths have left them orphans, were not married at the time of their birth. Disinherited by law and brutally ousted from Combe-Raven, the idyllic country estate which has been their peaceful home since childhood, the two young women are left to fend for themselves. While the submissive Norah follows a path of duty and hardship as a governess, her high-spirited and rebellious younger sister has made other decisions. Determined to regain her rightful inheritance at any cost, Magdalen uses her unconventional beauty and dramatic talent in recklessly pursuing her revenge. Aided by the audacious swindler Captain Wragge, she braves a series of trials leading up to the climactic test: can she trade herself in marriage to the man she loathes? Written in the early 1860s, between The Woman in Whiteand The Moonstone, No Namewas rejected as immoral by critics of its time, but is today regarded as a novel of outstanding social insight, showing Collins at the height of his powers.	The Cranford ChroniclesContains: Mr. Harrison's Confessions / Cranford / My Lady Ludlow In this witty and poignant story the railway is pushing its way relentlessly towards the town from Manchester, bringing fears of migrant workers and the breakdown of law and order. The arrival of handsome young Doctor Harrison causes yet further agitation not just because of his revolutionary methods but also because of his effect on the hearts of the ladies. Meanwhile Miss Matty Jenkyns nurses her own broken heart after she was forced to give up the man she loved when she was a young girl.

Black Hawk Down: A Story of Modern WarAlready winning acclaim as one of the best accounts of combat ever written, Black Hawk Down is a minute-by-minute, heart-stopping account of the 1993 raid on Mogadishu, Somalia. Late in the afternoon of Sunday, October 3 1993, 140 elite US Soldiers abseiled from helicopters into a teeming market neighbourhood in the heart of the city. Their mission was to abduct two top lieutenants of a Somali warlord and return to base. It was supposed to take them about an hour. Instead, they were pinned down through a long and terrible night in a hostile city, fighting for their lives against thousands of heavily armed Somalis. Two of their high-tech helicopters were shot out of the sky. When the unit was rescued the following morning, eighteen American soldiers were dead and more than seventy badly injured. The Somali toll was far worse - more than five hundred killed and over a thousand injured. Authoritative, gripping, and insightful, Black Hawk Down is destined to become a classic of war reporting. It is already the most accurate, detailed account of modern combat ever written.	Joker One: A Marine Platoon's Story of Courage, Leadership, and BrotherhoodAfter graduating from Princeton, Donovan Campbell, motivated by his unwavering patriotism and commitment, decided to join the service, realizing that becoming a Marine officer would allow him to give back to his country, engage in the world, and learn to lead. In this immediate, thrilling, and inspiring memoir, Campbell recounts a timeless and transcendent tale of brotherhood, courage, and sacrifice. As commander of a forty-man infantry platoon called Joker One, Campbell had just months to train and transform a ragtag group of brand-new Marines into a first-rate cohesive fighting unit, men who would become his family: Sergeant Leza, the house intellectual who read Che Guevara; Sergeant Mariano Noriel, the "Filipino ball of fire" who would become Campbell's closest confidant and friend; Lance Corporal William Feldmeir, a narcoleptic who fell asleep during battle; and a lieutenant known simply as "the Ox," whose stubborn aggressiveness would be more curse than blessing. Campbell and his men were assigned to Ramadi, that capital of the Sunni-dominated Anbar province that was an explosion just waiting to happen. And when it did happen-with the chilling cries of "Jihad, Jihad, Jihad!" echoing from minaret to minaret-Campbell and company were there to protect the innocent, battle the insurgents, and pick up the pieces. After seven months of day-to-day, house-to-house combat, nearly half of Campbell's platoon had been wounded, a casualty rate that went beyond that of any Marine or Army unit since Vietnam. Yet unlike Fallujah, Ramadi never fell to the enemy. Told by the man who led the unit of hard-pressed Marines, Joker Oneis a gripping tale of a leadership, loyalty, faith, and camaraderie throughout the best and worst of times.	Horse Soldiers: The Extraordinary Story of a Band of US Soldiers Who Rode to Victory in AfghanistanThe inspiration for the major motion picture 12 Strong from Jerry Bruckheimer, starring Chris Hemsworth and Michael Shannon. From the New York Times bestselling author of In Harm's Waycomes a true-life story of American soldiers overcoming great odds to achieve a stunning military victory. Horse Soldiersis the dramatic account of a small band of Special Forces soldiers who secretly entered Afghanistan following 9/11 and rode to war on horses against the Taliban. Outnumbered forty to one, they pursued the enemy army across the mountainous Afghanistan terrain and, after a series of intense battles, captured the city of Mazar-i-Sharif, which was strategically essential to defeat their opponent throughout the country. The bone-weary American soldiers were welcomed as liberators as they rode into the city, and the streets thronged with Afghans overjoyed that the Taliban regime had been overthrown. Then the action took a wholly unexpected turn. During a surrender of six hundred Taliban troops, the Horse Soldiers were ambushed by the would-be POWs. Dangerously overpowered, they fought for their lives in the city's immense fortress, Qala-i-Janghi, or the House of War. At risk were the military gains of the entire campaign: if the soldiers perished or were captured, the entire effort to outmaneuver the Taliban was likely doomed. Deeply researched and beautifully written, Stanton's account of the Americans' quest to liberate an oppressed people touches the mythic. The soldiers on horses combined ancient strategies of cavalry warfare with twenty-first-century aerial bombardment technology to perform a seemingly impossible feat. Moreover, their careful effort to win the hearts of local townspeople proved a valuable lesson for America's ongoing efforts in Afghanistan.	The Warrior Elite: The Forging of SEAL Class 228With a postscript describing SEAL efforts in Afghanistan, The Warrior Elite takes you into the toughest, longest, and most relentless military training in the world. What does it take to become a Navy SEAL? What makes talented, intelligent young men volunteer for physical punishment, cold water, and days without sleep? In The Warrior Elite, former Navy SEAL Dick Couch documents the process that transforms young men into warriors. SEAL training is the distillation of the human spirit, a tradition-bound ordeal that seeks to find men with character, courage, and the burning desire to win at all costs, men who would rather die than quit.	Roberts Ridge: A Story of Courage and Sacrifice on Takur Ghar Mountain, AfghanistanAfghanistan, March 2002. In the early morning darkness on a frigid mountaintop, a U.S. soldier is stranded, alone, surrounded by fanatical al Qaeda fighters. For the man's fellow Navy SEALs, and for waiting teams of Army Rangers, there was only one rule now: leave no one behind. In this gripping you-are-there account-based on stunning eyewitness testimony and painstaking research-journalist Malcolm MacPherson thrusts us into a drama of rescue, tragedy, and valor in a place that would be known as... ROBERTS RIDGE For an elite team of SEALs, the mission seemed straightforward enough: take control of a towering 10,240-foot mountain peak called Takur Ghar. Launched as part of Operation Anaconda-a hammer-and-anvil plan to smash Taliban al Qaeda in eastern Afghanistan -the taking of Takur Ghar would offer U.S. forces a key strategic observation post. But the enemy was waiting, hidden in a series of camouflaged trenches and bunkers-and when the Special Forces chopper flared on the peak to land, it was shredded by a hail of machine-gun, small arms, and RPG rounds. A red-haired SEAL named Neil Roberts was thrown from the aircraft. And by the time the shattered helicopter crash-landed on the valley floor seven miles away, Roberts's fellow SEALs were determined to return to the mountain peak and bring him out-no matter what the cost. Drawing on the words of the men who were there-SEALs, Rangers, medics, combat air controllers, and pilots-this harrowing true account, the first book of its kind to chronicle the battle for Takur Ghar, captures in dramatic detail a seventeen-hour pitched battle fought at the highest elevation Americans have ever waged war. At once an hour-by-hour, bullet-by-bullet chronicle of a landmark battle and a sobering look at the capabilities and limitations of America's high-tech army, Roberts Ridgeis the unforgettable story of a few dozen warriors who faced a single fate: to live or die for their comrades in the face of near-impossible odds.

The Commandant's choice for 1993 was We Were Soldiers Once . . . and Young. In November 1965, some 450 men of the 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry, under the command of Lt. Col. Hal Moore, were dropped by helicopter into a small clearing in the Ia Drang Valley. They were immediately surrounded by 2,000 North Vietnamese soldiers. Three days later, only two and a half miles away, a sister battalion was chopped to pieces. Together, these actions at the landing zones X-Ray and Albany constituted one of the most savage and significant battles of the Vietnam War. How these men persevered--sacrificed themselves for their comrades and never gave up--makes a vivid portrait of war at its most inspiring and devastating. General Moore and Joseph Galloway, the only journalist on the ground throughout the fighting, have interviewed hundreds of men who fought there, including the North Vietnamese commanders. This devastating account rises above the specific ordeal it chronicles to present a picture of men facing the ultimate challenge, dealing with it in ways they would have found unimaginable only a few hours earlier. It reveals to us, as rarely before, man's most heroic and horrendous endeavor.	ChickenhawkA true story from the battlefield that faithfully portrays the horror, the madness, and the trauma of the Vietnam War More than half a million copies of Chickenhawkhave been sold since it was first published in 1983.

This is Robert Mason's astounding personal story of men at war. A veteran of more than one thousand combat missions, Mason gives staggering descriptions that cut to the heart of the combat experience: the fear and belligerence, the quiet insights and raging madness, the lasting friendships and sudden death--the extreme emotions of a "chickenhawk" in constant danger.

Rendezvous with Destiny: Ronald Reagan and the Campaign That Changed AmericaAs late as Election Day, headlines across the country blared that the race was "too close to call." Even on the verge of his historic triumph in the 1980 presidential election, political observers continued to underestimate Ronald Wilson Reagan. In Rendezvous with Destiny, the long-awaited follow-up to his widely praised account of Reagan's insurgent 1976 presidential campaign, Craig Shirley tells the incredible behind-the-scenes story of Reagan's improbable run to the White House in 1980--of how the "too close to call" election became a landslide victory over incumbent Jimmy Carter and independent candidate John Anderson. And this, Shirley shows, was no ordinary election. It dramatically altered the course of American--and world--history. Reagan's victory gave rise to a new generation of conservatism, ended liberalism's half-century reign of dominance, reversed the second-worst economic crisis in American history, and led to the demise of the mighty Soviet Union. To write Rendezvous with Destiny, Shirley gained unprecedented access to 1980 campaign files and interviewed more than 150 insiders--from Reagan's closest advisers and family members to Jimmy Carter himself. The result is the first comprehensive history of the hard-fought 1980 campaign, a gripping account that follows Reagan's unlikely path from his bitter defeat on the floor of the 1976 Republican convention, through his underreported "wilderness years," through grueling primary fights in which he knocked out several Republican heavyweights, through an often-nasty general election campaign complicated by the presence of a third-party candidate (not to mention the looming shadow of Ted Kennedy), to Reagan's astounding victory on Election Night in 1980. Shirley's years of intensive research have enabled him to relate countless untold stories--including, at long last, the solution to one of the most enduring mysteries in politics: just how Reagan's campaign got hold of Carter's debate briefing books. Rendezvous with Destiny reveals how Reagan successfully battled the headwinds of the national media, the Republican Party establishment, and even his own campaign team to become one of America's greatest chief executives.	Reagan at Reykjavik: Forty-Eight Hours That Ended the Cold WarThe dramatic, first-hand account of the historic 1986 Reagan-Gorbachev summit in Iceland--the definitive weekend that was the key turning point in the Cold War--by President Reagan's arms control director, Ken Adelman. In October 1986, Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev met for a forty-eight-hour summit in Reykjavik, Iceland. Planned as a short, inconsequential gathering to outline future talks, the meeting quickly turned to major international issues, including the strategic defense initiative and the possibility of eliminating all nuclear weapons--negotiations that laid the groundwork for the most sweeping arms accord in history the following year. Scrupulously researched and based on now-declassified information, Reagan at Reykjaviktells the gripping tale of this weekend that changed the world. Filled with illustrative accounts of the private discussions between Reagan and his team, Ken Adelman provides an honest and up-close portrait of President Reagan at one of his finest and most challenging moments. Reagan at Reykjavik includes 16 pages of black-and-white photos and 11 illustrations.	Governor Reagan: His Rise To PowerA comprehensive biography of Ronald Reagan 's governorship, based on never-before mined cabinet minutes, recent interviews with former staff members, and a lifetime of reporting from the former president 's definitive biographer. In Governor Reagan, Lou Cannon offers -through recent interviews and research drawn from his unique access to the cabinet minutes of Reagan's first years as governor of California -a fresh look at the development of a master politician. At first, Reagan suffered from political amateurism, an inexperienced staff, and ideological blind spots. But he quickly learned to take the measure of the Democrats who controlled the State Legislature and surprised friends and foes alike by agreeing to a huge tax increase, which made it possible for him to govern for eight years without additional tax hikes. He developed an environmental policy that preserved the state 's scenic valleys and wild rivers, and he signed into law what was then the nation's most progressive declaration on abortion rights. His quixotic 1968 presidential campaign revealed his higher ambitions to the world and taught him how much he had to learn about big-league politics. Written by the definiti	The Kennedy Half-Century: The Presidency, Assassination, and Lasting Legacy of John F. KennedyJohn F. Kennedy died almost half a century ago--yet because of his extraordinary promise and untimely death, his star still resonates strongly. On the anniversary of his assassination, celebrated political scientist and analyst Larry J. Sabato--himself a teenager in the early 1960s and inspired by JFK and his presidency--explores the fascinating and powerful influence he has had over five decades on the media, the general public, and especially on each of his nine presidential successors. A recent Gallup poll gave JFK the highest job approval rating of any of those successors, and millions remain captivated by his one thousand days in the White House. For all of them, and for those who feel he would not be judged so highly if he hadn't died tragically in office, The Kennedy Half-Century will be particularly revealing. Sabato reexamines JFK's assassination using heretofore unseen information to which he has had unique access, then documents the extraordinary effect the assassination has had on Americans of every modern generation through the most extensive survey ever undertaken on the public's view of a historical figure. The full and fascinating results, gathered by the accomplished pollsters Peter Hart and Geoff Garin, paint a compelling portrait of the country a half-century after the epochal killing. Just as significantly, Sabato shows how JFK's presidency has strongly influenced the policies and decisions--often in surprising ways--of every president since. Among the hundreds of books devoted to JFK, The Kennedy Half-Century stands apart for its rich insight and original perspective. Anyone who reads it will appreciate in new ways the profound impact JFK's short presidency has had on our national psyche.	The Stranger: Barack Obama in the White HouseChuck Todd's gripping, fly-on-the-wall account of Barack Obama's tumultuous struggle to succeed in Washington. Barack Obama won the presidency in 2008 partly because he was a Washington outsider. But if he'd come to the White House thinking he could change the political culture, he soon discovered just how difficult it was to swim against an upstream of insiders, partisans, and old guard networks allied to undermine his agenda---including members of his own party. He would pass some of the most significant legislation in American history, but his own weaknesses torpedoed some of his greatest hopes. In The Stranger, Chuck Todd draws upon his unprecedented inner-circle sources to create a gripping account of Obama's White House tenure, from the early days of drift and helplessness to a final stand against the GOP in which an Obama, at last liberated from his political future, finally triumphs.	1960--LBJ vs. JFK vs. Nixon: The Epic Campaign That Forged Three PresidenciesIt was the election that would ultimately give America "Camelot" and its tragic aftermath, a momentous contest when three giants who each would have a chance to shape the nation battled to win the presidency. Award-winning author David Pietrusza does here for the 1960 presidential race what he did in his previous book, 1920: the Year of the Six Presidents--which Kirkus Reviewsselected as one of their Best Books of 2007. Until now, the most authoritative study of the 1960 election was Theodore White's Pulitzer Prize-winning The Making of the President, 1960. But White, as a trusted insider, didn't tell all. Here's the rest of the story, what White could never have known, nor revealed. Finally, it's all out--including JFK's poignant comment on why LBJ's nomination as vice president would be inconsequential: "I'm 43 years old. I'm not going to die in office." Combining an engaging narrative with exhaustive research, Pietrusza chronicles the pivotal election of 1960, in which issues of civil rights and religion (Kennedy was only the second major-party Roman Catholic candidate ever) converged. The volatile primary clash between Senate Majority leader LBJ and the young JFK culminated in an improbable fusion ticket. The historic, legendary Kennedy-Nixon debates followed in its wake. The first presidential televised debates, they forever altered American politics when an exhausted Nixon was unkempt and tentative in their first showdown. With 80 million viewers passing judgment, Nixon's poll numbers dropped as the charismatic Kennedy's star rose. Nixon learned his lesson--resting before subsequent debates, reluctantly wearing makeup, and challenging JFK with a more aggressive stance--but the damage was done. There's no one better to convey the drama of that tumultuous year than Pietrusza. He has 1,000 secrets to spill; a fascinating cast of characters to introduce (including a rogue's gallery of hangers-on and manipulators); and towering historical events to chronicle. And all of it is built on painstaking research and solid historical scholarship. Pietrusza tracks down every lead to create a winning, engaging, and very readable account. With the 2008 elections approaching, politics will be on everyone's mind, and 1960: LBJ vs. JFK vs. Nixonwill transform the way readers see modern American history. A sampling of what Theodore White couldn't chronicle--and David Pietrusza does: * Richard Nixon's tempestuous Iowa backseat blowup, and his bizarre Election Day road trip * The full story of a sympathetic call from JFK to Coretta Scott King * John Ehrlichman's spy missions on the Nelson Rockefeller and Democratic camps * The warnings beforeElection Day that Chicago's mayor Daley would try to fix the race's outcome * JFK's amphetamine-fueled debate performance	3601	1706	5231	2322	3654	187870	-1	55577	5	158\$\$The Reagan DiariesDuring his two terms as the fortieth president of the United States, Ronald Reagan kept a daily diary in which he recorded, by hand, his innermost thoughts and observations on the extraordinary, the historic, and the routine day-to-day occurrences of his presidency. Brought together in one volume and edited by historian Douglas Brinkley, "The Reagan Diaries" provides a striking insight into one of this nation's most important presidencies and sheds new light on the character of a true American leader.	White House DiaryHere is the edited, annotated diary of President Jimmy Carter - filled with insights into his presidency, his relationships with friends and foes, and his lasting impact on issues that still preoccupy America and the world. Each day during his presidency, Jimmy Carter made several entries in a private diary, recording his thoughts, impressions, delights, and frustrations. He offered unvarnished assessments of cabinet members, congressmen, and foreign leaders; he narrated the progress of secret negotiations, such as those that led to the Camp David Accords. When his four-year term came to an end in early 1981, the diary amounted to more than 5,000 pages. But this extraordinary document has never been made public - until now. By carefully selecting the most illuminating and relevant entries, Carter has provided us with an astonishingly intimate view of his presidency. Day by day, we see his forceful advocacy for nuclear containment, sustainable energy, human rights, and peace in the Middle East. We witness his interactions with such complex personalities as Ted Kennedy, Henry Kissinger, Joe Biden, Anwar Sadat, and Menachem Begin. We get the inside story of his so-called "malaise speech", his bruising battle for the 1980 Democratic nomination, and the Iranian hostage crisis. Remarkably, we also get Carter's retrospective comments on these topics and more: 30 years after the fact, he has annotated the diary with his candid reflections on the people and events that shaped his presidency, and on the many lessons learned. Carter is now widely seen as one of the truly wise men of our time. Offering an unprecedented look at both the man and his tenure, this fascinating book will stand as a unique contribution to the history of the American presidency.	DisinformationToday, still living undercover in the United States, the man credited by the CIA as the only person in the Western world who single-handedly demolished an entire enemy espionage service--the one he himself managed--takes aim at an even bigger target: the exotic, widely misunderstood but still astonishingly influential realm of the Russian-born "science" of disinformation. Indeed, within these pages, Pacepa, along with his co-author, historian and law professor Ronald Rychlak, expose some of the most consequential yet largely unknown disinformation campaigns of our lifetime. Here the reader will discover answers to many crucial questions of the modern era: Why, during the last two generations, has so much of the Western world turned against its founding faith, Christianity? Why have radical Islam, jihad and terrorism burst aflame after a long period of apparent quiescence? Why is naked Marxism increasingly manifesting in America and its NATO allies? What really happened to Russia after the Berlin Wall came down? Like the solution to a giant jigsaw puzzle lacking one crucial piece, Disinformation authoritatively provides the missing dimension that makes the chaos of the modern world finally understandable. By its very nature, a disinformation campaign can work only if the seemingly independent Western press accepts intentionally fabricated lies and presents them to the public as truth. Thus, Pacepa and Rychlak also document how the U.S. "mainstream media's" enduring sympathy for all things liberal-left has made it vulnerable to--indeed, the prime carrier of--civilization-transforming campaigns of lying, defamation and historical revisionism that turn reality on its head.	RN: The Memoirs of Richard NixonFormer President Richard Nixon's bestselling autobiography is an intensely personal examination of his life, public career, and White House years. With startling candor, Nixon reveals his beliefs, doubts, and behind-the-scenes decisions, shedding new light on his landmark diplomatic and domestic initiatives, political campaigns, and historic decision to resign from the presidency. Memoirs, spanning Nixon's formative years through his presidency, reveals the personal side of Richard Nixon. Witness his youth, college years, and wartime experiences, events which would shape his outward philosophies and eventually his presidency--and shape our lives. Follow his meteoric rise to national prominence and the great peaks and depths of his presidency. Throughout his career Richard Nixon made extensive notes about his ideas, conversations, activities, meetings. During his presidency, from November 1971 until April 1973 and again in June and July 1974, he kept an almost daily diary of reflections, analyses, and perceptions. These notes and diary dictations, quoted throughout this book, provide a unique insight into the complexities of the modern presidency and the great issues of American policy and politics.	Power to the PeopleIn her latest, radio personality and author Ingraham (Shut up and Sing) calls on the American people to take back the phrase "Power to the People" from the anti-establishment groups of yesterday that, today, have made the country, according to Ingraham, "a slave to fringe groups, political correctness, expanding bureaucracies, and our own consumerism." Taking an approach that makes mutually exclusive groups out of those "working and taking care of their families" and the "protest culture," Ingraham's message is loud and clear: "they're coming for you." Specifically, "they" means the Lifetime network (brainwashing women to "swear off men and family"), the growing ranks of "Team Atheist" (including Dan Brown), "family deconstructivists," illegal immigrants and Islamic jihadists, among others. Chapters cover most of today's hot button topics-the war in Iraq, homeland security, the judiciary, the news media and global warming-with attitude and conviction. Ingraham's commentary on the lack of education in our schools and the "pornification" of the culture contain her most sound, articulate arguments (bolstered by a wealth of statistics), but Ingraham's assembling tactics are overzealous; still, fans of her strident radio show should be pleased to find more of the same here.

Walking After YouMasa lalu akan tetap ada. Kau tidak perlu terlalu lama terjebak di dalamnya. Pada kisah ini, kau akan bertemu An. Perempuan dengan tawa renyah itu sudah lama tak bisa keluar dari masa lalu. Ia menyimpan rindu, yang membuatnya semakin kehilangan tawa setiap waktu. Membuatnya menyalahkan doa-doa yang terbang ke langit. Doa-doa yang lupa kembali kepadanya. An tahu, seharusnya ia tinggalkan kisah sedih itu berhari-hari lalu.

The book definitely held my interest. Overall, It was a very good story, right up there with Charlaine Harris (True Blood series). I was a little disappointed at the end because I was wanting the story to continue but isn't that the test of a good book; always leave the reader wanting more !!! Myra D., Book Fanatic Normally I don't care for romances or westerns, but I loved "Run into the Wind." It was wonderfully written, contains mysteries, satisfying, and unforgettable...

Prophetic Untimeliness: A Challenge to the Idol of RelevanceNever have Christians tried to be so relevant. But never have Christians ended up so irrelevant. Why? Why do so many compromise in the face of modern pressure? Prophetic Untimeliness is a hard-hitting critique written with a deep love for the church that explores why Christians compromise in today's time-oriented culture. Author Os Guinness offers constructive suggestions for living with integrity and challenges readers to work out what it means to be faithful without being trivial or trendy. With a creative approach, Guinness calls Christians to become "untimely people"--people who are faithful despite the mesmerizing lure of the present age. Only by such untimeliness, he says, can Christians speak with integrity and wisdom in a world that is hungry for some truly good news.	Christ and Culture RevisitedCalled to live inthe world, but not to be of it, Christians must maintain a balancing act that becomes more precarious the further our culture departs from its Judeo-Christian roots. How should members of the church interact with such a culture, especially as deeply enmeshed as most of us have become? D. A. Carson applies his masterful touch to this problem. He begins by exploring the classic typology of H. Richard Niebuhr with its five Christ-culture options. Carson proposes that these disparate options are in reality one still larger vision. Using the Bible's own story line and the categories of biblical theology, he clearly lays out that unifying vision. Carson acknowledges the helpfulness of Niebuhr's grid and similar matrices but warns against giving them canonical force. More than just theoretical, Christ and Culture Revisitedis also designed practically to help Christians untangle current messy debates on living in the world. Carson emphasizes that the relation between Christ and culture is not limited to an either/or cultural paradigm -- Christ againstculture or Christtransformingculture. Instead Carson offers his own paradigm in which allthe categories of biblical theology must be kept in mind simultaneously to inform the Christian worldview. While many other books on culture interact with Niebuhr, none of them takes anything like the biblical-theological approach adopted here. Groundbreaking and challenging, Christ and Culture Revisitedis a tour de force.	Craving Grace: Experience the Richness of the Gospel"I was stuck. I believed the gospel changed people, but I knew it wasn't changing me. My head was filled with knowledge about God, but my heart was not convinced He even knew my name. How could I live as His child while feeling like a spiritual orphan?" -- Ruthie Delk Are you stuck? Craving something but don't know what? Ruthie Delk shares a clear and concrete way to preach the gospel to yourself. We all need to be reminded of the gospel, the real gospel that brings freedom and life and hope, a gospel that is worth celebrating and sharing. This book will empower you to move from a cycle of resistance, separation, and loneliness to a life of restoration and freedom.	The Gospel According to NatureWhat if God has more to say? What if the natural beauty around you could be translated like a foreign language? What if God meant for us to read nature like a long letter? Have you ever wondered why the sky isn't purple? God could have designed a universe where rain falls up instead of down, but He decided against it. We only have one moon, but He could have given us two. Though you cannot imagine it, He could have created a system without gravity, or one where life forms don't need water to survive. But, He didn't. God literally made trillions upon trillions of decisions when He created our universe. Nothing that you see had to be the way it is. So, did God make all of those creative decisions on a whim? Or did He have a purpose? If so, what was that purpose? Author Zack Mason posits that His purpose was to communicate with men and women of all ages through natural symbols. That every part of nature is a symbolic word that can be added to others until entire sentences and even paragraphs can be interpreted, just as if nature were a foreign language. Join Zack on a journey of discovery as he attempts to decipher the code, to see if God did indeed write into nature a symbolic message -- and what He might have to say.	Dynamics of Spiritual LifeRichard Lovelace gives a history of spiritual renewals in light of biblical models. Isolating the elements of live orthodoxy, he proposes a comprehensive approach to renewal. Lovelace looks at such practical issues as renewal of the local congregation, the ways revivals go wrong, the evangelical thrust toward church unity, and Christian approaches to the arts and to social concern. A book for all concerned to revitalize the church.	The Great Evangelical DisasterHave Christians compromised their stand on truth and morality until there is almost nothing they will speak out against? Has the evangelical church itself sold out to the world? A provocative and challenging book--but one that is tempered by Dr. Schaeffer's deep commitment to Christ and love for the church.	1422	5942	2078	3196	1900	60972	-1	58051	-1	274\$\$The Global War on Christians: Dispatches from the Front Lines of Anti-Christian PersecutionOne of the most respected journalists in the United States and the bestselling author of The Future Churchuses his unparalleled knowledge of world affairs and religious insight to investigate the troubling worldwide persecution of Christians. From Iraq and Egypt to Sudan and Nigeria, from Indonesia to the Indian subcontinent, Christians in the early 21st century are the world's most persecuted religious group. According to the secular International Society for Human Rights, 80 percent of violations of religious freedom in the world today are directed against Christians. In effect, our era is witnessing the rise of a new generation of martyrs. Underlying the global war on Christians is the demographic reality that more than two-thirds of the world's 2.3 billion Christians now live outside the West, often as a beleaguered minority up against a hostile majority-- whether it's Islamic fundamentalism in the Middle East and parts of Africa and Asia, Hindu radicalism in India, or state-imposed atheism in China and North Korea. In Europe and North America, Christians face political and legal challenges to religious freedom. Allen exposes the deadly threats and offers investigative insight into what is and can be done to stop these atrocities. "This book is about the most dramatic religion story of the early 21st century, yet one that most people in the West have little idea is even happening: The global war on Christians," writes John Allen. "We're not talking about a metaphorical 'war on religion' in Europe and the United States, fought on symbolic terrain such as whether it's okay to erect a nativity set on the courthouse steps, but a rising tide of legal oppression, social harassment and direct physical violence, with Christians as its leading victims. However counter-intuitive it may seem in light of popular stereotypes of Christianity as a powerful and sometimes oppressive social force, Christians today indisputably form the most persecuted religious body on the planet, and too often its new martyrs suffer in silence." This book looks to shatter that silence.	Bonhoeffer the Assassin?: Challenging the Myth, Recovering His Call to PeacemakingMost of us think we know the moving story of Dietrich Bonhoeffer's life--a pacifist pastor turns anti-Hitler conspirator due to horrors encountered during World War II--but does the evidence really support this prevailing view? This pioneering work carefully examines the biographical and textual evidence and finds no support for the theory that Bonhoeffer abandoned his ethic of discipleship and was involved in plots to assassinate Hitler. In fact, Bonhoeffer consistently affirmed a strong stance of peacemaking from 1932 to the end of his life, and his commitment to peace was integrated with his theology as a whole. The book includes a foreword by Stanley Hauerwas.	Prophetic Untimeliness: A Challenge to the Idol of RelevanceThe buzz among evangelicals today is about relevance and reinvention, about new ways of "doing church" through revising, innovating, borrowing, mixing, and experimenting. Yet, says Os Guinness, in our uncritical pursuit of relevance, Christians have actually become irrelevant. By our determined efforts to redefine ourselves in ways that are more in line with the modern world than are faithful to Christ, we have lost not only our identity but our authority and significance. Prophetic Untimeliness addresses this issue by giving practical, constructive solutions for living with integrity in the midst of modern pressures. Guinness explores what it means to be both faithful and relevant, and how to be truly relevant without being trivial or trendy. Readers will be challenged to develop "resistance thinking," an approach inspired by C. S. Lewis that balances the uncomfortable truths of the gospel with the pursuit of relevance. Only by being true to Christ and living with integrity and wisdom will we meet the needs of a world that is hungry for some really good news.	The Historical David: The Real Life of an Invented HeroDavid is one of the most celebrated characters in the Bible. We know him as the brave young man who defeated Goliath, the first king of a united Israel, the composer of the beloved Psalms, and, for Christians, the messianic forerunner to Jesus. And yet for all the glory we attribute to David's legend, the historical reality is both fascinating and disturbing. In The Historical David, Joel Baden reveals that, in David's case, the Bible is political spin, "the goal of which is to absolve David of any potential guilt and to show him in a positive light." Through deep textual analysis, Baden reveals how the historical David has been painstakingly and successfully diminished, replaced by the portrait of a glorious king we are now familiar with. To question David's legend opens up a debate about what it means to be a descendant of David--be it nationally, ethnically, or religiously. In The Historical David, Baden confronts this challenge, bringing the historical David vibrantly to life, and ultimately revealing that the flesh-and-blood man was far more complex and interesting than the mythical king.	November 22, 1963: Ordinary and Extraordinary People Recall Their Reactions When They Heard the News…An extensive collection of intimate accounts from average citizens and celebrities alike, reflecting on John F. Kennedy's assassination for the fiftieth commemoration of the tragic event November 22, 1963--any American alive that day can pinpoint exactly where they were when they heard that President John F. Kennedy had been shot. Jodie Hansen, as shocked and horrified as the rest of the nation, channeled her grief into a fascinating project. From 1978 to 1983 she sent thousands of queries asking both famous and ordinary citizens for their memories of those dark, confusing days. She and daughter Laura Hansen have collected the responses she received into a stunning and poignant time capsule: November 22, 1963. With dozens of unique and notable voices,November 22, 1963 offer a rare narrative of John F. Kennedy's assassination and its impact on America and the world. Assembled fifteen years after the event, Hansen was shocked by the outpouring of responses she received. Hollywood stars Bob Hope and Mary Tyler Moore wrote back, as did Arthur Miller, Julia Child, Indira Gandhi, Princess Grace of Monaco, George and Barbara Bush, Ronald and Nancy Reagan, Michael Crichton, and even the deranged Charles Manson. Their stories weave together the personal and the political, the ordinary and the extraordinary for a rich and unforgettable portrayal of a nation's shared tragedy. Timed for the fiftieth Anniversary of John F. Kennedy's assassination, November 22, 1963 provides a kaleidoscopic portrait of this defining moment that reaches across generations.	The History of the Catholic Church: From the Apostolic Age to the Third MillenniumThe Catholic Church is the longest-enduring institution in the world. Beginning with the first Christians and continuing in our present day, the Church has been planted in every nation on earth.The Catholic Church claims Jesus Christ himself as her founder, and in spite of heresy from within and hostility from without, she remains in the twenty-first century the steadfast guardian of belief in his life, death, and resurrection. The teachings and redemptive works of Jesus as told in the Gospels are expressed by the Church in a coherent and consistent body of doctrine, the likes of which cannot be found in any other Christian body. The history of the Catholic Church is long, complicated, and fascinating, and in this book it is expertly and ably told by historian James Hitchcock. As in the parable of Christ about the weeds that were sown in a field of wheat, evil and good have grown together in the Church from the start, as Hitchcock honestly records. He brings before us the many characterssome noble, some notoriouswho have left an indelible mark on the Church, while never losing sight of the saints, who have given living testimony to the salvific power of Christ in every age. This ambitious work is comprehensive in its scope and in incisive in its understanding, a valuable addition to any school or home library.	2602	710	3589	6585	5698	91351	-1	16581	-1	158

Opening in Depression-era New York City, The Carpenter's Gift tells the story of eight-year-old Henry and his father selling Christmas trees. They give a Christmas tree to construction workers building Rockefeller Center and celebrate together. Through the kindness of the construction workers and neighbors, Henry gets his wish for a nice, warm home to replace his family's drafty shack. He plants a pinecone from that first Rockefeller Center Tree. As an old man, Henry repays the gift by donating the enormous tree that has grown from that pinecone. After bringing joy to thousands as the Rockefeller Center tree, its wood will be used to build a home for another family in need. Written by children's nonfiction author David Rubel in collaboration with Habitat for Humanity. Gorgeous illustrations crafted by Jim LaMarche.	The Twelve Days of ChristmasThe astounding talent of Laurel Long brings this beloved song to life with breathtaking style.

The Third GiftFrom two extraordinary talents, a beautifully crafted picture book for the Christmas season. The three wise men, or the three kings, are familiar figures in the Christmas tradition. Newbery medalist Linda Sue Park has taken the brief biblical references to the three as the starting point for a new story. In it we meet a boy who is learning his father's trade; a man who gathers resin from certain trees; a merchant in the marketplace; and three strangers in brightly colored robes who are shopping for a gift for a baby. Illustrated by Bagram Ibatoulline with exquisite paintings, this simple, moving tale of ordinary people involved in an extraordinary event brings new resonance to the well-known gift list of gold, frankincense, and myrrh. Includes an author's note.	Apple Tree ChristmasIllustrated by Trinka Hakes NobleOriginally published over twenty years ago, and out of print since 1998, Sleeping Bear Press is proud to bring this beloved Christmas tale to a whole new audience. Moving and nostalgic, and brought to life by glowing watercolor paintings, it reveals the joy of a very special present and the love that a father and daughter share.	Shooting at the StarsShooting at the Starsis the moving story of a young British soldier on the front lines during World War I who experiences an unforgettable Christmas Eve. In a letter home to his mother, he describes how, despite fierce fighting earlier from both sides, Allied and German soldiers ceased firing and came together on the battlefield to celebrate the holiday. They sang carols, exchanged gifts, and even lit Christmas trees. But as the holiday came to a close, they returned to their separate trenches to await orders for the war to begin again.John Hendrix wonderfully brings this story to life, interweaving fact and fiction along with his detailed illustrations and hand-lettered text. His story celebrates the humanity and kindness that can persist even during the darkest periods of our history. Back matter includes a glossary, additional information about World War I and the Christmas Truce and its aftermath, and an archival photograph taken during the Truce.	6428	3928	4122	2349	5918	110108	118077	11936	-1	158

Getting under his skin gives her an unexplainable satisfaction, and it doesn't hurt that Joe is the picture of masculine perfection, especially when he's angry.

But when circumstances force the two of them together, they might find love where they least expect.

James had assured him that his daughter was safely away in Miami. So when he sees the woman he'd met on the beach talking to James, even hugging him, Chase regretfully moves her to the top of his suspect list. It's not until James invites them both to join him in his private dining room that they discover each other's true identities. Lansing convinces Chase to become his daughter's personal bodyguard until the situation with the threats is taken care of. Being thrown together twenty-four seven is the last thing Chase wants, considering the unexpected feelings he has for Shay. Distraction can make a man careless. But he accepts, determined to protect her and her son with his life. For the first time since her divorce, a man stirs Shay's passion. More importantly, he makes her son smile.

She's a straight-shooter, a tell-it-like-it-is, no filter kind of girl. Kathryn's honesty and straightforwardness is the ultimate turn on for a guy like Dre. He's never met someone so sincere, so full of truth and innocence. Their chemistry is unavoidable, their connection, magnetic. When Dre sets out to make Kathryn fall for him, he doesn't realize the grave mistake he's making. Kathryn's strength and convictions do not falter, even for an irresistible man like Dre. When his past resurfaces, and the lies come tumbling forth, Kathryn must decide if his deceit and betrayal can be forgiven or if the damage is irreparable. Will the truth ultimately destroy the relationship that neither one of them could deny or even attempt to resist? This novel is for mature readers only, due to language and sexual content.

In it, Bahaa' Taher, one of a group of Egyptian writers--including the Nobel Laureate Naguib Mahfouz--noted for their revealing portraits of Egyptian life and society, tells the dramatic story of a young Muslim who, when his life is threatened, finds sanctuary in a community of Coptic monks. It is a tale of honor and of the terrible demands of blood vengeance; it probes the question of how a people or nation can become divided against itself. Taher has a magical gift for evoking the village life of Upper Egypt--a vastly different setting than urban Cairo and a landscape that tourists usually glimpse only from the windows of trains and buses taking them to the Pharaonic sites. Here, where Christians and Muslims have coexisted peacefully for centuries, where the traditions of the Coptic Church are as powerful as those of the Muslims, Taher crafts an intricate and compelling tale of far-reaching implications. With a powerful narrative voice and a genius for capturing the complex nuances of human interaction, Taher brilliantly depicts the poignant drama of a traditional society caught up in the process of change.	2133	4204	4806	121	4964	51520	-1	30925	64	274\$\$ذات"dht" shkhSy@ lrwy'y Sn` llh brhym lmHwry@ wlty nb`tht mn zHm@ lHy@ ltb`th khylh wtGdhy fkrh b'lf Swr@ wSwr@... hy mn lwq`... wlknh tsry fy l'Hdth lrwy'y@... fykwn lwq` twjdh 'lf m`n~ wm`n~...

Restless Giant: The United States from Watergate to Bush vs. Gore (Oxford History of the United States, vol. 11)In Restless Giant, acclaimed historical author James Patterson provides a crisp, concise assessment of the twenty-seven years between the resignation of Richard Nixon and the election of George W. Bush in a sweeping narrative that seamlessly weaves together social, cultural, political, economic, and international developments. We meet the era's many memorable figures and explore the "culture wars" between liberals and conservatives that appeared to split the country in two. Patterson describes how America began facing bewildering developments in places such as Panama, Somalia, Bosnia, and Iraq, and discovered that it was far from easy to direct the outcome of global events, and at times even harder for political parties to reach a consensus over what attempts should be made. At the same time, domestic issues such as the persistence of racial tensions, high divorce rates, alarm over crime, and urban decay led many in the media to portray the era as one of decline. Patterson offers a more positive perspective, arguing that, despite our often unmet expectations, we were in many ways better off than we thought. By 2000, most Americans lived more comfortably than they had in the 1970s, and though bigotry and discrimination were far from extinct, a powerful rights consciousness insured that these were less pervasive in American life than at any time in the past. With insightful analyses and engaging prose, Restless Giantcaptures this period of American history in a way that no other book has, illuminating the road that the United States traveled from the dismal days of the mid-1970s through the hotly contested election of 2000. The Oxford History of the United States The Oxford History of the United States is the most respected multi-volume history of our nation. The series includes three Pulitzer Prize winners, a New York Timesbestseller, and winners of the Bancroft and Parkman Prizes. The Atlantic Monthlyhas praised it as "the most distinguished series in American historical scholarship," a series that "synthesizes a generation's worth of historical inquiry and knowledge into one literally state-of-the-art book." Conceived under the general editorship of C. Vann Woodward and Richard Hofstadter, and now under the editorship of David M. Kennedy, this renowned series blends social, political, economic, cultural, diplomatic, and military history into coherent and vividly written narrative.			4920	5132	2816	318	2476	177878	-1	-1	71	-1

She didn't mean to, but her mother had ordered her to stay away from her Sunday school crush: "He's a nice boy - don't you ruin him." So she kept her feelings hidden, telling herself that no matter how sweet he seemed, he'd still end up turning on her, like everyone else did. Jacob never loved anyone like he loved Marissa. He knows he should try to forget about her, especially now that he's engaged and she's happily married - or so everyone says. Even though they've grown and gone their separate ways, in their tightly-knit community, that still means seeing each other at every Sunday service, church picnic and backyard barbecue. He swears that her eyes still have that sad, haunted look, but he manages to keep his distance. Until one night, when everything changes. With Jacob's relationship in shambles and Marissa pushed to the breaking point, they're drawn together by an unstoppable force. Temptation is irresistible. Giving in is unthinkable. But it soon becomes clear that nothing - neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation- can keep them apart.

Ask them to define discipline,however, and you will find little agreement. Many parenting experts support a strict, "hands-on" approach-usually in the form of spankings. Other believers think a permissive, "hands-off" is the best way to demonstrate love. Caught between these extremes, well-meaning parents feel torn and even more confused about what the Bible really says on the subject. Is there a better way to lovingly train and guide our kids? Yes,says author Clay Clarkson, and in Heartfelt Discipline he offers a long-awaited, biblical discipline solution that is caring and effective-one that leaves parents feeling confident and guiltless, not saddened or conflicted. At last, here is a faith-directed approach to discipline that spares the rod but doesn't spoil the children. Through biblical advice, answers to commonly asked questions, and positive encouragement, Clay Clarkson presents a new, biblical model of discipline-one that allows parents to embrace a completely new way of thinking about childhood discipline, renew their relationships with their children, and transform the dynamics of their family life.	Hope For The Weary Mom"Right now, I have nothing to give. Nothing. Nada. I'm tired and don't feel good and honestly, I want a break from everything. It's not that I want to leave my family, trade them in, or get new ones. I WANT to be with them. I just want a break from hard hearts, discipline, correction. I want their hearts changed and I can't do it myself. Sometimes, the knowledge of this makes me feel hopeless and helpless." ~A Weary Mom Does that sound like you?

Have Space Suit - Will TravelClifford Russell had always dreamed of going to the moon. He'd even got himself a space suit. Then, out of the blue, his chance came. But the journey was to be very different from anything he'd imagined - and a lot further. Clifford was kidnapped. And launched by his captors on an adventure which would end in a galactic trial of the human race - a trial where the defence depended entirely on Clifford C. Russell!	Gray Lensman (Lensman, #4)Somewhere among the galaxies was the stronghold of Boskone - a network of brilliant space-criminals whose hunger for conquest threatened the continued existence of all known civilization. But where was stronghold? Boskonian bases were scattered across the universe - shielded by gigantic thought-screens that defied penetration. The best minds in the Galactic Patrol had tried. And failed. Now it was up to Lensman Kim Kinnison, using his fantastic powers, to infiltrate the Boskonian strongholds, find the location of the enemy's Grand Base - and smash it forever. But Kinnison didn't know then that the power of Boskone reached further than anyone had dreamed - into the Galactic Patrol itself...	Rite of PassageIn 2198, one hundred and fifty years after the desperate wars that destroyed an overpopulated Earth, Man lives precariously on a hundred hastily-established colony worlds and in the seven giant Ships that once ferried men to the stars. Mia Havero's Ship is a small closed society. It tests its children by casting them out to live or die in a month of Trial in the hostile wilds of a colony world. Mia Havero's Trial is fast approaching and in the meantime she must learn not only the skills that will keep her alive but the deeper courage to face herself and her world. Published originally in 1968, Alexei Panshin's Nebula Award-winning classic has lost none of its relevance, with its keen exploration of societal stagnation and the resilience of youth.	The Witches of Karres (The Witches of Karres, #1)Blazing interstellar adventure by the creator of Telzey Amberdon and Trigger Argee. Captain Pausert thought his luck had finally turned-but he did not yet realize it was a turn for the worse. On second thought, make that a turn for the disastrous! Pausert thought he had made good with his battered starship, successfully selling off odd-ball cargoes no one else could sell. And then he made the mistake of freeing three slave children from their masters (who were suspiciously eager to part with them). No good deed goes unpunished, and those harmless-looking young ladies were just trying to be helpful, but those three adorable little girls quickly made Pausert the mortal enemy of his fiancee, his home planet, the Empire, warlike Sirians, psychopathic Uldanians, the dread pirate chieftain Laes Yango-and even the Worm World, the darkest threat to mankind in all of space. And all because those harmless-looking little girls were in fact three of the notorious and universally feared Witches of Karres. A rollicking novel from the master of space adventure.	ThornsDuncan Chalk is a monstrous media mogul with a vast appetite for other people's pain. He feeds off it, and carefully nurtures it in order to feed it to the public. It is inevitable that Chalk should home in on Minner Burris, a space traveller whose body was taken apart by alien surgeons and then put back together again - differently. Burris' pain is constant. And so is that of Lona Kelvin, used by scientists to supply eggs for 100 children and then ruthlessly discarded. Only an emotional vampire like Chalk can see the huge audience eager to watch a relationship develop between these two damaged people. And only Chalk can make it happen. First published in 1967	The Weapon Shops of IsherWith the publication, in the July 1941 issue of Astounding Science Fiction magazine, of the story Seesaw, van Vogt began unfolding the complex tale of the oppressive Empire of Isher and the mysterious Weapon Shops. This volume, The Weapon Shops of Isher, includes the first three parts of the saga and introduces perhaps the most famous political slogan of science fiction: The Right to Buy Weapons is the Right to Be Free. Born at the height of Nazi conquest, the Isher stories suggested that an oppressive government could never completely subjugate its own citizens if they were well armed. The audience appeal was immediate and has endured long beyond other stories of alien invasion, global conflict and post war nuclear angst.	2412	5915	5446	3752	998	69739	-1	20561	11	191\$\$The Unreasoning MaskIt is capable of alaraf drive: instantaneous travel between two points of space. Three of these special ships were built to explore and make contact with the many sentient races inhabiting the universe. Suddenly, one of the ships mysteriously disappears. And then it is discovered that an unidentifiable creature is marauding through the universe, totally annihilating intelligent life on planet after planet. Ramstan, a thoughtful and moral man, becomes a fascinated yet reluctant pawn in the hands of the strange forces which arise to fight the deadly destroyer. Ultimately, he is the one man who, in a fearful race against time, can stop the destruction. But what price must he pay for becoming the savior of intelligent-kind? The Unreasoning Mask is Farmer at his best: fast-paced, complex, slightly mystical, high-action adventure.	LimboAlthough Bernard Wolfe has written several plays, most for television, it is principally for his 1952 science fiction novel Limbo that he's best remembered. Penguin Books republished this work in a slightly abridged form in 1961, claiming it was "the first book of science fiction to project the present-day concept of 'cybernetics' to its logical conclusion". Taken from this viewpoint, Limbo is an early example of the New Wave movement in science fiction, and could even be argued to be a precocious predecessor of the cyberpunk literature of the 1980s. Limbo takes place largely in the future year 1990: for that reason, its British editions are titled Limbo '90.	Walk to the End of the World (Holdfast Chronicles, #1)The men of the Holdfast had long treated with contempt the degenerated creatures known as "fems." To give themselves the drive to survive and reconquer the world, the men needed a common enemy. Superstitious belief had ascribed to the fems the guilt for the terrible Wasting that had destroyed the world. They were the ideal scapegoat. The truth was lost in death and decay and buried in history. It was going to be a long journey back...	The Palace Of Eternity'The planet Mnemosyne, surrounded by a lambent shell of tiny moon-fragments, was known throughout the Federation as the Poets' World. It was a beautiful planet far inside the frontiers of Man's long war with the alien Pythsyccans, and it was to this quiet world that Mack Tavernor retired when he resigned from the Federation forces. But suddenly the peace of Mnemosyne was shattered; the Federation was moving its military headquarters here. Man's forces were in retreat - and now that Mnemosyne had become Earth's military centre, it became also the target of wave after wave of alien attacks, in a continuing onslaught that could not fail to break through Man's last defences. Tavernor was caught up in that battle, and he knew that neither he nor humanity would ever again find the peace they sought... unless, perhaps, in death.' Blurb from the 1969 Ace Paperback Edition	The AlterationIn Kingsley Amis's virtuoso foray into virtual history it is 1976 but the modern world is a medieval relic, frozen in intellectual and spiritual time ever since Martin Luther was promoted to pope back in the sixteenth century. Stephen the Third, the king of England, has just died, and Mass (Mozart's second requiem) is about to be sung to lay him to rest. In the choir is our hero, Hubert Anvil, an extremely ordinary ten-year-old boy with a faultless voice. In the audience is a select group of experts whose job is to determine whether that faultless voice should be preserved by performing a certain operation. Art, after all, is worth any sacrifice. How Hubert realizes what lies in store for him and how he deals with the whirlpool of piety, menace, terror, and passion that he soon finds himself in are the subject of a classic piece of counterfactual fiction equal to Philip K. Dick's The Man in the High Castle. The Alterationwon the John W. Campbell Memorial Award for best science-fiction novel in 1976.	Juniper TimeJuniper Time is a 1st-rate sf novel. Kate Wilhelm has done her usual excellent job of weaving an intricate plot & sympathetically portraying believable & complex characters in settings that are described with force & clarity. This '79 novel is set in the not-too-distant future, when a devastating drought in the American West & much of the rest of the world has caused economic & social collapse. The story alternates between the viewpoints of Cluny, a scientist dedicated to the construction & operation of a space station, & Jean, who was Cluny's childhood friend but has now gone her separate way & become a linguist, naturalist & photographer. Wilhelm's most powerful & engrossing writing, it seems to me, is in her descriptions of the natural world & of the vastly different ways that people relate to it. Jean's experiences on the Oregon coast are beautifully described, as is her life on the high desert of Oregon with the Wasco Indians. (Wilhelm & husband Damon Knight live in Bend) Jean gradually comes to understand the way of life of the Wasco people & her spiritual growth is described very effectively. Cluny & Jean are reunited when they become part of a project intended to discover if contact with an alien civilization has occurred. Their decision may determine whether a nuclear war between the USA & the USSR can be avoided. The climax of the novel is unexpected but believable. I recommend this book very highly.--Michael J.

Carry Yourself Back to MeFamed alt-country artist Annie Walsh has more than enough reason to sing her version of the blues, including a broken heart, a stalled career, and a troubled family. Annie seeks refuge from an upended love affair with her producer, Owen Pettybone, by sequestering herself at home with her old dog Detour, surrounded by a lush Florida tangelo grove. There, she spends her days furiously sanding down the house's every veneer in a vain attempt at erasing the painful memory of the love she lost. Soon, however, this quiet, small town existence--far from recording studios, ardent fans, and affairs of the heart--comes crashing down around her. A violent murder connected to her brother Calder threatens to tear her family apart and forces Annie to shore up her loyalties and uproot profound disappointments from her distant past. The evidence stacks against Calder, compounded by his lifelong affliction with Tourette syndrome that causes some in the community to cast aspersions on the soundness of his mind. As the circumstances converge to challenge lifetime ties and forge unexpected new bonds, this soulful, stirring novel shifts its narrative from an imperiled and ever-changing present, where each hour brings an unforeseen and unwelcome piece of news, to the poignant childhood days of first allegiances and life-altering loss. Like a fine and forlorn love ballad, the gifted, conflicted Annie lulls the reader into a journey through love and loss that mines the mysterious, and, at times, paradoxical rhythms of the human heart. As vibrant as Annie's treasured tangelo grove, Carry Yourself Back to Me cultivates an always tender, sometimes tart, portrait of one family's regret and redemption. Inflected with melancholy and redeemed by melody, this deeply affecting novel is certain to strike a resonant chord with music fans and lovers of fine fiction everywhere.	Home is a Roof Over a Pig: An American Family's Journey in ChinaWhen all-American Aminta Arrington moves from suburban Georgia to a small town in China, she doesn't go alone. Her army husband and three young children, including an adopted Chinese daughter, uproot themselves too. Aminta hopes to understand the country with its long civilization, ancient philosophy, and complex language. She is also determined that her daughter Grace, born in China, regain some of the culture she lost when the Arringtons brought her to America as a baby. In the university town of Tai'an, a small city where pigs' hooves are available at the local supermarket, donkeys share the road with cars, and the warm-hearted locals welcome this strange looking foreign family, the Arringtons settle in . . . but not at first. Aminta teaches at the university, not realizing she is countering the propaganda the students had memorized for years. Her creative, independent (and loud) American children chafe in their classrooms, the first rung in society's effort to ensure conformity. The family is bewildered by the seemingly endless cultural differences they face, but they find their way. With humor and unexpectedly moving moments, Aminta's story is appealingly reminiscent of Reading Lolita in Tehran. It will rivet anyone who is thinking of adopting a child, or anyone who is already familiar with the experience. An everywoman with courage and acute cultural perspective, Aminta recounts this transformative quest with a freshness that will delight anyone looking for an original, accessible point of view on the new China.

Soon after, the child began to play, developing quickly into a prodigy who immersed herself in the work of such classical masters as Bach and Brahms. Her astonishing proficiency earned her a spot at the Beijing Conservatory at the tender age of eleven, where she began laying the foundation for a promising career as a concert pianist. But in 1966, with the onset of the Cultural Revolution, life as she knew it ended abruptly. The Communist Party's campaign against culture forced the closure of art schools and resulted in the deportation of countless Chinese, including Xiao-Mei and her entire family. She spent five years in a work camp in Inner Mongolia, suffering under abysmal living conditions and a brutal brainwashing campaign. Yet through it all, Xiao-Mei kept her dream alive, drawing on the power of music to sustain her courage.	Conditions are Favorable"Welcome to our world...I know it, I sense it, you aren't here to simply fly. You are searching. You are here to find yourself, fill some kind of hole in your heart...there's no other reason why such fine men would be here but to find--or maybe lose--yourselves. Which is it?" Fall into the year 1900 at Kitty Hawk, NC, when life consists of shipwrecks, shoot-outs...and flying machines. When Orville and Wilbur Wright arrive to conduct flight experiments, their posh dignity stands in stark contrast to a community of rough old salts who believe in a "good God, a bad devil, a hot hell, and more than anything else, that the same good God did not intend for man to ever fly." The Wright brothers may be able to defy divine edicts, theorize about relative velocities and engineer the world's first flying machine. But when it comes to women, they are terribly love-shy. That doesn't deter Kitty Hawker Madeleine Tate. When she meets these two odd bicycle mechanics from Ohio, she is immediately struck by the brothers' intellect, dandy appearance--and their grip on bachelorhood. Their shyness and fixation on flight puzzles her, too, but she finds her growing fondness for Orville hard to resist. He represents a splendid taste of the Outside World, the place where she can escape the poverty and fear that define life on a stormy sandbar. And Orville is flattered by her affections, but he has long-accepted the fact that he and Wilbur are social misfits who let one bad experience with courtship harden their hearts forever. He finds his shyness, obsessions and memories tough obstacles to overcome. But Madeleine is determined to break through his shell to find out who he really is--a brilliant inventor? A lunatic risking his life for the sake of something the world deems impossible? Or is he someone just like her, with real hurts, dreams and desires? With stunning detail that rings true of early twentieth century life, author Tara Staley artfully depicts the story of two individuals who both, in their own unique ways, learn to spread their wings and fly. "Gorgeously written, with the time, the place and the people evoked so dazzlingly, you can hear the wings of the Wright's flying machine, wafting in the air."

The BlueDerek may or may not deserve to be stalked by an unhinged ex-marine - he's not sure. He did kill the man's entire family in a car accident, and he may have been drinking, though thanks to the resulting coma he can't remember much about that day. And that's okay, because Derek is learning all about it from the district attorney as he explains to the jury why the young painter should go to prison. Prison isn't right now, though - it isn't breaking into his home, stabbing him, or kidnapping him at gunpoint. And managing his stalker would be much easier if Derek could see him coming. But, he's incapable of recognizing the man tormenting him, or anyone else. Can't even recognize his own face in the mirror. Since Derek woke up from his coma, he's been face blind: a rare condition that renders him unable to identify people by their appearances. Anyone in Derek's world of strangers could be his stalker. In this mind-bending thriller, the talented painter is pushed to a tipping point as his reality unravels at the hands of a madman. On its surface, The Blue is a gritty suspense novel about a man's quest for redemption. Dig deeper and it asks questions about the nature of guilt, innocence, reality and revenge.	1502	1191	1080	1612	3440	35804	-1	13492	11	48

The Invisible Arab: The Promise and Peril of the Arab RevolutionsThe Invisible Arab traces the roots of the revolutions in the Arab world. Marwan Bishara, chief policy analyst of Al Jazeera English and the anchor of the program "Empire", combines on-the-ground reporting, extensive research and scholarship, and political commentary in this book on the complex influences that made the revolutions possible. Bishara argues that the inclusive, pluralistic nationalism that motivated the revolutions are indispensable to their long-term success.The Invisible Arab is a voyage in time from the Arab world's 'liberation generation' through the 'defeated' and 'lost generations', arriving at today's 'miracle generation'. Bishara unpacks how this new generation, long seen as a demographic bomb, has proved to be the agent of progress, unity and freedom. It has in turn used social networks to mobilize for social justice.Bishara discusses how Israel, oil, terrorism and radical Islam have affected the interior identity of the region as well as Western projections upon it. Protection of Israel, Western imperial ambition, a thirst for oil, and fear of radicalism have caused many Western regimes and media to characterize Arab countries and people as unreceptive to democracy or progress. These ideas are as one-dimensional as they are foolhardy. Bishara argues that the Arab revolutions present a great window of opportunity for reinventing and improving Arab ties with the rest of the world-- notably the West--on the basis of mutual respect and mutual interest.The revolutions will be judged by how they realize freedom and justice, and how they can pave the way for reconciling and accommodating nationalism and Islam with democracy. Bishara argues that these pillars--liberty and justice reconciled with religion and nationalism, form the bedrock that will allow stability and progress to flourish in the Arab world and beyond.

A Force for Good: How Enlightened Finance Can Restore Faith in CapitalismAfter the crisis of 2008, the social contract between the financial industry and everyone else was badly broken-perhaps, it seemed, irrevocably. Since then, banks have paid out billion-dollar settlements and Congress has passed some new laws, but a deeper rapprochement is still missing. John Taft has gathered some of the greatest financial minds of our time to explore how Wall Street can harness the same creative energy that invented credit default swaps and channel it towards the public good- in the form of a stable retirement system, investment strategies that protect the environment and reward responsible corporate behavior, and a financial industry with a culture of ethics, integrity and client focus. These perspectives, from a who's who of leaders in the field, offer a blueprint for a new kind of responsible finance and banking that secures the future for everyone. Contributors include: * Robert Shiller on financial capitalism and innovation *Charles D. Ellis on restoring ethical standards *Sheila Bair on regulatory reform *John C. Bogle and Mary Schapiro on rebuilding investor trust *Judd Gregg on long-term fiscal imbalances *Barbara Novick on the retirement savings gap *David Blood on sustainable finance. With so much brainpower in the financial sector, the potential for change is limitless. A Force for Goodis the call to action the industry sorely needs.

It is already here, waiting to be found and used: it does not need to be invented or improved. It is, however, mysterious - that is its nature. And that is the conundrum: how to find and use something inherently mysterious. For many of us, this conundrum can almost stop our efforts to find it. But I know I was born with magic - it came with my soul. I use this gift every day. I consider myself lucky to be able to do that for the benefit of many others, some human, some animal. But it has not always been so: my journey has had it's ups and downs. Magic has brought loss as well as gain, and pain as much as a sense of identity. Many people I've met have journeyed as though magic was somewhere over the horizon, aeons away, almost alive and determined to evade capture. I would like to tell you about my journey, so that you may gain ideas and encouragement for your own personal path. My main point is that Old Magic is close-by, still relevant and very, very interesting. This book is for those seeking explanation and understanding of a path which is calling to them. At the beginning of a journey, the fear of feeling different or even insane can stop you in your tracks. I hope to reassure you that you are neither mad nor alone on this path. To many this story may seem fanciful or exaggerated, but it is as true as I can make it. To some it may be unbelievable, but to others this may feel like a story so familiar it could be their own. The back of the book offers exercises and inspirations for you to try, or to immerse yourself in, because I have been guided to offer them. May your journey be one of excitement and illumination, but mainly a safe and happy one.

But when his estranged daughter Sarah comes to him with a request he cannot refuse, Moe takes a deep breath and plunges back into the icy, opaque waters of secrets and lies. Sashi Bluntstone, an eleven-year-old art prodigy and daughter of Sarah's dearest childhood friend, has been abducted. Three weeks into the investigation, the cops have gotten nowhere and the parents have gotten desperate. Desperation, the door through which Moe Prager always enters, swings wide open. Just as in Sashi's paintings, there's much more to the case than one can see at a glance. With the help of an ex-football star, Moe stumbles around the fringes of the New York art scene, trying to get a handle on where the art stops and the commerce begins. Much to Moe's surprise and disgust, he discovers that Sashi is, on the one hand, revered as a cash cow and, on the other, reviled as a fraud and a joke. Suspects abound beyond the usual predators and pedophiles, for it is those closest to Sashi in life who have the most to gain from her death.

De Boer, the long-suppressed story of Mary's vital role in the life of Jesus and in the formative period after his crucifixion presents as authentically as possible the real Mary Magdalene	The Gnostic BibleGnosticism was a wide-ranging religious movement of the first millennium CE--with earlier antecedents and later flourishings--whose adherents sought salvation through knowledge and personal religious experience. Gnostic writings offer striking perspectives on both early Christian and non-Christian thought. For example, some gnostic texts suggest that god should be celebrated as both mother and father, and that self-knowledge is the supreme path to the divine. Only in the past fifty years has it become clear how far the gnostic influence spread in ancient and medieval religions--and what a marvelous body of scriptures it produced. The selections gathered here, in poetic, readable translation, represent Jewish, Christian, Hermetic, Mandaean, Manichaean, Islamic, and Cathar expressions of gnostic spirituality. Their regions of origin include Egypt, the Greco-Roman world, the Middle East, Syria, Iraq, China, and France. Also included are introductions, notes, an extensive glossary, and a wealth of suggestions for further reading.	Reading Judas: The Gospel of Judas and the Shaping of ChristianityTwo gnostic gospels experts weigh in on the meaning of the controversial Gospel of Judas. When it was published by Nat'l Geographic in 4/06, it received extraordinary media attention & was heralded as a major biblical discovery that rocked scholars & laity alike. Pagels & King are the 1st to reflect on this text & its ramifications for telling the story of early Christianity. Reading Judasillustrates how the text provides a window onto understanding how Jesus' followers understood his death, why Judas betrayed Jesus & why god allowed it. Most contemporary readers will find passages in the Gospel of Judas difficult to comprehend outside of its context in the ancient world. Reading Judasilluminates the intellectual assumptions behind Jesus' teaching to Judas & shows how conflict among the disciples was a tool frequently used by early Christian authors to explore matters of doubt & disagreement. Presented with the elegance, insight & accessibility that has made Pagels & King popular, this is a book for all audiences. Introduction 1 Reading Judas/ Elaine Pagels & Karen L. King Judas: betrayer or favored disciple? Judas & the twelve Sacrifice & the life of the spirit The mysteries of the kingdom A final note 2 The Gospel of Judas/ Karen L. King English translation of the Gospel of Judas Comments on the translation Index of cross-references Notes Acknowledgments Index	The Lost Gospel: The Book of Q and Christian OriginsThe first book to give the full account of the lost gospel of Jesus' original followers, revealing him to be a Jewish Socrates who was mythologized into the New Testament Christ.	The Jesus Family Tomb: The Discovery, the Investigation & the Evidence That Could Change HistoryThe Jesus Family Tomb tells the story of what may very well be the greatest archeological find of all time: the discovery & investigation of the Jesus family tomb. The tomb in question houses ossuaries (bone boxes) with inscriptions bearing the names of Jesus of Nazareth, the Virgin Mary, Mary Magdalene & Judas, the son of Jesus. This crypt had been overlooked & ignored for years & exists today under a patio just outside of Jerusalem. The authors have tracked down the location & been granted unequaled access to inspect the findings within the tomb. The artifacts were found, recorded & catalogued by professional archeologists in a controlled setting. There's no question of their authenticity. A fascinating combination of history, archeology & theology, the revelations inside the book will change the way we think about god, religion & everything 'known' about the life & death of Jesus.	710	2602	3196	482	319	147083	92213	12490	16	274\$\$The Secrets of Judas: The Story of the Misunderstood Disciple & His Lost GospelTHE SECRETS OF JUDAS Traces the Trail of the Text, the Skullduggery Surrounding the Sale of the Gospel and Sets the Record Straight on the Life of the Most Misunderstood Disciple As news about the discovery and translation of the lost Gospel of Judas explodes, the first book about the mysterious gospel--an authentic papyrus manuscript from the 4th century-- reveals what we can and cannot know about the historical Judas. In THE SECRETS OF JUDAS renowned scholar James Robinson unravels the mystery of the enigmatic disciple and asks whether we should reconsider his place in history, culture, and faith. For the first time the sensational story of the discovery of a gospel attributed to Judas is told, and Judas s newfound significance for history and Christian faith is exposed. Chapter by chapter THE SECRETS OF JUDAS delves into every aspect of Judas--from the words attributed to him, to his historical significance to the "peddling" of the Judas Gospel, to the forthcoming publication of the Gospel of Judas by The National Geographic Society. THE SECRETS OF JUDAS reveals the unvarnished truth of the controversial discovery and scandalous sale of the lost Gospel of Judas and how it changes our view of the "evil" disciple--all told by one of the world's foremost scholars of ancient documents.	Gnosticism: New Light on the Ancient Tradition of Inner KnowingGnosticism developed alongside Judeo-Christianity over two thousand years ago, but with an important difference: It emphasizes, not faith, but direct perception of God--Gnosticism being derived from the Greek word gnosis, meaning "knowledge." Given the controversial premise that one can know God directly, the history of Gnosticism is an unfolding drama of passion, political intrigue, martyrdom, and mystery. Dr. Hoeller traces this fascinating story throughout time and shows how Gnosticism has inspired such great thinkers as Voltaire, Blake, Yeats, Hesse, Melville, and Jung.	The Word on the Street'Rob helped me discover angry and sad voices in passages of the Bible that had left me indifferent, and he made me laugh at other passages so familiar that I had never seen the healthy irreverence, humor and irony they expressed.' --Dr. David Trobisch, Professor of New Testament Language and Literature, Bangor Theological Seminary For those who've never read the Bible, and for those who've read it too much. Rob Lacey's 'dangerously real' retelling of Scripture vividly demonstrates that the Bible is packed full of stories/poems/images that resonate with the big issues of today. This fresh paraphrase with running commentary brings the text alive: Bible stories are retold as mini-blockbusters; psalms as song lyrics; epistles as emails; Revelation as a virtual reality. Out with stale religious terms, here's a 'Bible' that talks today's language---gritty, earthy, witty. Enough of starting at Genesis with good intentions but getting lost in Leviticus. Lacey succeeds in revitalizing a classic work by focusing on the big picture: fast-forwards through the 'slow-moving' bits with pace, passion and energy to make the Bible a page-turner again. What's more, Lacey's award-winning* tour de force was created during a remarkable personal journey through terminal cancer: the stuff the Bible stories are made of. This life-experience injects Lacey's take on Scripture with authenticity and authority---resonating with Bible characters who also wrestled with the big questions. Purist alert: This is not THE Bible (capital B) ... but it might just get you reaching for one. *Book of the year (2004), Christian Booksellers Convention Ltd.

The Sion Revelation: The Truth About the Guardians of Christ's Sacred BloodlineAn essential notion in the #1 New York Timesbestseller The Da Vinci Codeis the existence of an age-old French society, the Priory of Sion, whose task it is to protect Christ's sacred bloodline.

My Happy LifeA simple woman looks back on her harsh life with extraordinary insight and unexpected joy At the opening of My Happy Life, the unnamed narrator of this bittersweet fictional memoir has been abandoned in a locked room of a defunct hospital for the mentally ill. She hasn't seen the nice man who brings her food in days; she's eaten the soap and the toothpaste; she tried to eat the plaster on her walls, a dietary adventure that ended none too well. And yet, curiously, the narrator is happy. Despite a lifetime of neglect, physical abuse, and loss, she's incapable of perceiving slight or injury. She has infinite faith in the goodwill of others, loves even her enemies, and finds grace and communion in places most people wouldn't dare to look. By stepping outside her meager circumstances, she's able to live each moment as though it were her last-with gratitude, longing, and delight.

The Sunset Strip DiariesThere comes a time in every girl's life, where she has to choose good or choose bad. Amy Asbury chose bad, hands down. Good meant wallflowers, secretaries and subservient wives. Bad meant power- and a possible escape from a life of secrets. At twelve years old she was trying to make sense of a drug-addicted father and his disturbing behavior. By fifteen she was dealing with horrendous depression, blackouts and rape. At sixteen she was in a mental institution for suicidal tendencies and violent behavior. She knew she could never be normal. The only place for a girl like her was Hollywood. This is a true story of the social ascent (and eventual decline) of a girl in the Sunset Strip music scene of the early 1990's. From crazy parties to glittered junkies and man-eating strippers, Amy has chronicled what life was like back in the days of excess and debauchery. It is not just a fascinating look into an amusing time in pop culture, but also details the mindset of a young woman trying to find confidence and self-worth in a life full of pain and chaos. The party came screeching to a halt when the Grunge movement took over and heroin became more prominent. How far off track can a person go before it's too late?

Don't Go Where I Can't FollowDon't Go Where I Can't Followis a tender collection of letters, photographs, and drawings Anders Nilsen has compiled in memory of his fiancee, Cheryl Weaver, who died of cancer in November 2005.

The Inevitable: Contemporary Writers Confront DeathBirth is not inevitable. Life certainly isn't. The sole inevitability of existence, the only sure consequence of being alive, is death. In these eloquent and surprising essays, twenty writers face this fact, among them Geoff Dyer, who describes the ghost bikes memorializing those who die in biking accidents; Jonathan Safran Foer, proposing a new way of punctuating dialogue in the face of a family history of heart attacks and decimation by the Holocaust; Mark Doty, whose reflections on the art-porn movie Bijou lead to a meditation on the intersection of sex and death epitomized by the AIDS epidemic; and Joyce Carol Oates, who writes about the loss of her husband and faces her own mortality. Other contributors include Annie Dillard, Diane Ackerman, Peter Straub, and Brenda Hillman.	Stories II: The Collected Stories of T. Coraghessan Boyle, Volume IIA second volume of collected short fiction from the bestselling author and winner of the 2015 Rea Award for the Short Story Few authors write with such sheer love of story and language as T.C. Boyle, and that is nowhere more evident than in his inventive, wickedly funny, and always entertaining short stories. In 1998, T.C. Boyle Stories brought together the author's first four collections to critical acclaim. Now, T.C. Boyle Stories IIgathers the work from his three most recent collections along with fourteen new tales previously unpublished in book form as well as a preface in which Boyle looks back on his career as a writer of stories and the art of making them. By turns mythic and realistic, farcical and tragic, ironic and moving, Boyle's stories have mapped a wide range of human emotions. The fifty-eight stories in this new volume, written over the last eighteen years, reflect his maturing themes. Along with the satires and tall tales that established his reputation, readers will find stories speaking to contemporary social issues, from air rage to abortion doctors, and character-driven tales of quiet power and passion. Others capture timeless themes, from first love and its consequences to confrontations with mortality, or explore the conflict between civilization and wildness. The new stories find Boyle engagingly testing his characters' emotional and physical endurance, whether it's a group of giants being bred as weapons of war in a fictional Latin American country, a Russian woman who ignores dire warnings in returning to her radiation-contaminated home, a hermetic writer who gets more than a break in his routine when he travels to receive a minor award, or a man in a California mountain town who goes a little too far in his concern for a widow. Mordant wit, emotional power, exquisite prose: it is all here in abundance. T.C. Boyle Stories II is a grand career statement from a writer whose imagination knows no bounds.

Your eyes would gaze gently from beneath your bony brow-ridge.	6193	1720	2263	3362	1392	152443	-1	53459	71	83\$\$Fool's Gold (The Dragon Lords #1)A brand new adventure fantasy: imagine Guardians of the Galaxyplanning a heist on Smaug's gold, for fans looking for something with a modern twist and some humor.

There are humans on Paradise but dinosaurs predominate: wildlife, monsters, beasts of burden, and of war. Armored knights ride dinosaurs to battle legions of war-trained Triceratops and their upstart peasant crews. Karyl Bogomirsky is one such knight who has chosen to rally those who seek a way from the path of war and madness. The fact that the Empire has announced a religious crusade against this peaceful kingdom, the people who just wish to live in peace anathema, and they all are to be converted or destroyed doesn't help him one bit. Things really turn to mud when the dreaded Grey Angels, fabled ancient weapons of the Gods who created Paradise in the first place come on the scene after almost a millennia. Everyone thought that they were fables used to scare children. They are very much real. And they have come to rid the world of sin...including all the humans who manifest those vices.

SepharadFrom one of Spain's most celebrated writers, an extraordinary, inspired book-at once fiction, history, and memoir-that draws on the Sephardic diaspora, the Holocaust, and Stalin's purges to tell a twentieth-century story. Shifting seamlessly from the past to the present and following the routes of escape across countries and continents, Munoz Molina evokes people real and imagined who come together in a richly allusive pattern-from Eugenia Ginsburg to Grete Buber-Neumann, the one on a train to the gulag, the other to a Nazi concentration camp; from a shoemaker and a nun who become lovers in a small town in Spain to Primo Levi bound for Auschwitz. And others-some well known, others unknown-all voices of separation, nostalgia, love, and endless waiting. Written with clarity of vision and passion, in a style both lyrical and accessible, Sepharad makes the experience our own. A brilliant achievement.	Los girasoles ciegosEste libro es el regreso a las historias reales de la posguerra, que contaron en voz baja narradores que no querian contar cuentos sino hablar de sus amigos, de sus familiares desaparecidos, de ausencias irreparables. Son historias de los tiempos del silencio, cuando daba miedo que alguien supiera que sabias. Cuatro historias, sutilmente engarzadas entre si, contadas desde el mismo lenguaje pero con los estilos propios de narradores distintos que van perfilando la verdadera protagonista de esta narracion: la derrota. Todo lo que se narra aqui es verdad, pero nada de lo que se cuenta es cierto, porque la certidumbre necesita aquiescencia y la aquiescencia necesita estadisticas.	Panteón (Panteón, #1)La Tierra, el planeta original, exploto hace algo mas de diez mil anos. Por aquel entonces el hombre ya habia iniciado su periplo por el espacio. En esta nueva Era, la guerra y la paz son elementos de una misma balanza que se equilibran cuidadosamente desde La Colonia, el enclave cientifico por excelencia. Desde alli, la controladora Maralda Tardes detecta actividad belica en un planeta alejado de cualquier ruta comercial, y decide iniciar un protocolo estandar de inspeccion. Mientras tanto, Ferdinard y Malhereux, dos jovenes chatarreros, esperan pacientemente en el subsuelo de dicho planeta a que acabe la guerra en la superficie para saquear los restos del combate y extraer un suculento beneficio. Entre los restos de la batalla encuentran un extrano artefacto que parece pertenecer a una civilizacion antigua y desconocida y tras el que van los atroces mercenarios sarlab y los cientificos de La Colonia por igual. Poco se imaginan Mal y Fer que lo que tienen en su poder podria ser la llave para liberar una amenaza mas antigua que la galaxia.	Un minuto antes de la oscuridadTras una serie de colapsos y revueltas, Madrid se ha replegado sobre si misma y ha dejado de ser una ciudad segura mas alla de la M-30. Las autoridades han cortado todos los suministros a los barrios del exterior, donde la policia ya hace tiempo que no patrulla. Cada dia, familias como la de Ciro, Sole y su hijo se encierran en casa y cuentan los minutos hasta el anochecer, cuando una extrana multitud silenciosa toma las calles. En medio de esta atmosfera irrespirable, Ciro debera elegir entre huir con los suyos o luchar contra el avance de la barbarie: un dilema que partira por la mitad el corazon de esta familia y que les llevara a cuestionarse quienes son en realidad.	Landscapes of the Metropolis of Death: Reflections on Memory and ImaginationOtto Dov Kulka's Landscapes of the Metropolis of Death, translated by Ralph Mandel and Ina Friedman, is a memoir of astounding literary and emotional power, exploring the permanent and indelible marks left by the Holocaust and a childhood spent in Auschwitz. As a child the distinguished historian Otto Dov Kulka was sent first to the ghetto of Theresienstadt and then to Auschwitz. As one of the few survivors he has spent much of his life studying Nazism and the Holocaust, but always as a discipline requiring the greatest dispassion and objectivity, with his personal story set to one side. He has nevertheless remained haunted by specific memories and images, thoughts he has been unable to shake off. The extraordinary result of this is Landscapes of the Metropolis of Death- a unique and powerful experiment in how one man has tried to understand his past (and our history).	En la orillaLibrarian's note: Alternate cover edition of ISBN13 9788433997593. El hallazgo de un cadaver en el pantano de Olba pone en marcha la narracion. Su protagonista, Esteban, se ha visto obligado a cerrar la carpinteria de la que era dueno, dejando en el paro a los que trabajaban para el. Mientras se encarga de cuidar a su padre, enfermo en fase terminal, Esteban indaga en los motivos de una ruina que asume en su doble papel de victima y de verdugo, y entre cuyos escombros encontramos los valores que han regido una sociedad, un mundo y un tiempo.

Entre la atraccion y la repulsion, no puede evitar sentirse fascinada por este personaje insolito y perfeccionista, que vive fuera de toda norma social y que la corteja a traves de suntuosos regalos robados. <>Su necesidad de poner distancia cuando Knut se vuelve demasiado absorbente, pero tambien su irrefrenable curiosidad y el ansia de vivir experiencias mas alla de una existencia excesivamente reglada, llevaran a Sonia a una doble vida secreta en la que quedara atrapada durante anos sin posibilidad de exculparse. En esta inusitada historia, Sara Mesa recupera temas que ya aparecieron en sus primeras obras narrativas, dandoles forma a traves de un estilo conciso y electrico en un mundo -frio, escasamente comunicativo- cuyas reglas establecen unicamente los propios personajes que lo habitan. Cicatriz no es solo una inquietante historia de amor descompensado protagonizada por dos seres muy distintos pero a la vez complementarios, es tambien una reflexion sobre la sociedad de consumo y los robos a gran escala en grandes almacenes, la sumision y el poder, la anulacion del deseo y la carnalidad, el refugio de la infancia, la fantasia como alternativa, la culpa y la expiacion, la escritura y la vocacion literaria. La autora de la celebrada Cuatro por cuatro (que fue finalista del Premio Herralde de Novela), en vias de publicacion al frances, se confirma con Cicatriz como una de las voces mas singulares e imprescindibles de su generacion.	A House in the CountryGames turn to nightmares during the summer holidays at the magnificent Chilean country estate of the Ventura family when the children - 33 cousins ranging in age from 6 to 16 - are left to themselves while their parents pursue their own pastimes. (Nancy Pearl)	I pesci non chiudono gli occhiLa crescita e il passaggio dall'adolescenza all'eta matura raccontato da Erri De Luca, scrittore napoletano classe '50 che decide di ambientare I pesci non chiudono gli occhiproprio nel mare dove si affaccia Napoli, tra le barche rovesciate dell'isola di Ischia. La storia di un giovane ragazzo, che durante una lunga estate impara l'arte della pesca e l'arte di vivere, prendendo le misure con il mondo circostante e scoprendo nuove dimensioni dell'esistere. La pesca, con le sue tecniche per fare in modo che i pesci abbocchino ed entrino nella rete, porta con se una saggezza in grado di aiutare a comprendere la vita. Gli affetti familiari sono radicati nel giovane, ma poco piu in la c'e tutto il resto del mondo. E l'esplorazione dei nuovi orizzonti riempie il petto, lo colma di desiderio per una donna, lo arricchisce di una vitalita che fa battere il cuore, di passione per la scoperta di cio che sta oltre. E per completare il passaggio significativo arrivera lo strappo, la ferita, lo scontro che permettera una piu profonda comprensione della realta e del modo in cui e necessario agire per rapportarsi ad essa da persona matura. I pesci non chiudono gli occhi, di Erri De Luca, rappresenta il raggiungimento dell'eta adulta, l'acquisizione di una prospettiva differente, la scoperta di nuove passioni, e la fotografia del momento in cui si decide di compiere il tuffo nella vita.

Il processoJosef K., condannato a morte per una colpa inesistente, e vittima del suo tempo. Sostiene interrogatori, cerca avvocati e testimoni, soltanto per riuscire a giustificare il suo delitto di "esistere". Ma come sempre avviene nella prosa di Kafka, la concretezza incisiva delle situazioni produce, su personaggi assolutamente astratti, il dispiegarsi di una tragedia di portata cosmica. E allora tribunale e il mondo stesso, tutto quello che esiste al di fuori di Josef K. e processo: non resta che attendere l'esecuzione di una condanna da altri pronunciata.	Berlin AlexanderplatzBiberkopf hat geschworen, er will anstandig sein, und ihr habt gesehen, wie er wochenlang anstandig ist, aber das war gewissermassen nur eine Gnadenfrist. Das Leben findet das auf die Dauer zu fein und stellt ihm hinterlistig ein Bein. Die Geschichte des Transportarbeiters Franz Biberkopf, der, aus der Strafanstalt Berlin-Tegel entlassen, als ehrlicher Mann ins Leben zuruckfinden mochte, ist der erste deutsche Grossstadtroman von literarischem Rang. Das Berlin der Zwanziger Jahre ist der Schauplatz des Geschehens. Dabei wird die Grossstadt selbst zum Gegenspieler des gutmutig-jahzornigen Franz Biberkopf, der dieser verlockenden, aber auch unerbittlichen Welt zu trotzen versucht. Mit Berlin Alexanderplatz vollzog Doblin die radikale Abkehr vom burgerlich psychologischen Roman. Hier wurde kein Einzelschicksal analysiert. Das kollektive Geschehen, das Allgemeine einer menschlichen Situation erfuhr hier eine gultige dichterische Gestaltung. Der Roman zahlt zu den grossen Epen unserer Zeit.	Sentimental EducationBased on Flaubert's own youthful passion for an older woman, Sentimental Education was described by its author as "the moral history of the men of my generation." It follows the amorous adventures of Frederic Moreau, a law student who, returning home to Normandy from Paris, notices Mme Arnoux, a slender, dark woman several years older than himself. It is the beginning of an infatuation that will last a lifetime. He befriends her husband, an influential businessman, and as their paths cross and re-cross over the years, Mme Arnoux remains the constant, unattainable love of Moreau's life. Blending love story, historical authenticity, and satire, Sentimental Education is one of the great French novels of the nineteenth century.	The Notebooks of Malte Laurids BriggeThe Notebooks of Malte Laurids Briggeis Rilke's major prose work and was one of the earliest publications to introduce him to American readers. The very wide audience which Rilke's work commands today will welcome the reissue in paperback of this extremely perceptive translation of the Notebooksby M. D. Herter Norton. A masterly translation of one of the first great modernist novels by one of the German language's greatest poets, in which a young man named Malte Laurids Brigge lives in a cheap room in Paris while his belongings rot in storage. Every person he sees seems to carry their death within them and with little but a library card to distinguish him from the city's untouchables, he thinks of the deaths, and ghosts, of his aristocratic family, of which he is the sole living descendant. Suffused with passages of lyrical brilliance, Rilke's semi-autobiographical novel is a moving and powerful coming-of-age story.	The Radetzky MarchThe Radetzky March charts the history of the Trotta family through three generations spanning the rise and fall of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Through the Battle of Solferino to the entombment of the last Hapsburg emperor, Roth's intelligent compassion illuminates the crumbling of a way of life.	Sodom and Gomorrah (In Search of Lost Time, #4)Sodom and Gomorrah- now in a superb translation by John Sturrock - takes up the theme of homosexual love, male and female, and dwells on how destructive sexual jealousy can be for those who suffer it. Proust's novel is also an unforgiving analysis of both the decadent high society of Paris, and the rise of a philistine bourgeoisie that is on the way to supplanting it. Characters who had lesser roles in earlier volumes now reappear in a different light and take center stage, notably Albertine, with whom the narrator believes he is in love, and the insanely haughty Baron de Charlus.	482	5675	3227	5481	4285	86970	29769	48126	134	274\$\$The Wall'The Wall', the lead story in this collection, introduces three political prisoners on the night prior to their execution. Through the gaze of an impartial doctor--seemingly there for the men's solace--their mental descent is charted in exquisite, often harrowing detail. And as the morning draws inexorably closer, the men cross the psychological wall between life and death, long before the first shot rings out. This brilliant snapshot of life in anguish is the perfect introduction to a collection of stories where the neurosis of the modern world is mirrored in the lives of the people that inhabit it.	Exile and the KingdomThese six stories, written at the height of Camus' artistic powers, all depict people at decisive, revelatory moments in their lives. Translated by Justin O'Brien. The six works collected in this volume are: "The Adulterous Woman" ("La Femme adultere") "The Renegade or a Confused Spirit" ("Le Renegat ou un esprit confus") "The Silent Men" ("Les Muets") "The Guest" ("L'Hote") "Jonas or the Artist at Work" ("Jonas ou l'artiste au travail") "The Growing Stone" ("La Pierre qui pousse")	Viper's TangleThe masterpiece of one of the twentieth century's greatest Catholic writers, Vipers' Tangle tells the story of Monsieur Louis, an embittered aging lawyer who has spread his misery to his entire estranged family. Louis writes a journal to explain to them--and to himself--why his soul has been deformed, why his heart seems like a foul nest of twisted serpents. Mauriac's novel masterfully explores the corruption caused by pride, avarice, and hatred, and its opposite--the divine grace that remains available to each of us until the very moment of our deaths. It is the unforgettable tale of the battle for one man's soul.	HellA young man staying in a Paris boarding house finds a hole in the wall above his bed. Alternately voyeur and seer, he obsessively studies the private moments and secret activities of his neighbors: childbirth, first love, marriage, betrayal, illness and death all present themselves to him through this spy hole. Decades ahead of its time, "Hell" shocked and scandalized the reviewing public when first released in English in 1966. Even so, the New Republic praised "the beauty of the book's nervous yet fluid rhythms... The book sweeps, away life's illusions."	Strait is the GateA delicate boy growing up in Paris, Jerome Palissier spends many summers at his uncle's house in the Normandy countryside, where the whole world seems 'steeped in azure'. There he falls deeply in love with his cousin Alissa and she with him. But gradually Alissa becomes convinced that Jerome's love for her is endangering his soul. In the interests of his salvation, she decides to suppress everything that is beautiful in herself - in both mind and body.	Zazie in the MetroImpish, foul-mouthed Zazie arrives in Paris from the country to stay with her uncle Gabriel. All she really wants to do is ride the metro, but finding it shut because of a strike, Zazie looks for other means of amusement and is soon caught up in a comic adventure that becomes wilder and more manic by the minute. In 1960 Queneau's cult classic was made into a hugely successful film by Louis Malle. Packed full of word play and phonetic games, 'Zazie in the Metro' remains as stylish and witty as ever.	482	2816	1559	871	6328	162158	-1	62184	71	-1
Physics of the Impossible: A Scientific Exploration into the World of Phasers, Force Fields, Teleportation, and Time TravelA fascinating exploration of the science of the impossible--from death rays and force fields to invisibility cloaks--revealing to what extent such technologies might be achievable decades or millennia into the future. One hundred years ago, scientists would have said that lasers, televisions, and the atomic bomb were beyond the realm of physical possibility. In Physics of the Impossible, the renowned physicist Michio Kaku explores to what extent the technologies and devices of science fiction that are deemed equally impossible today might well become commonplace in the future. From teleportation to telekinesis, Kaku uses the world of science fiction to explore the fundamentals--and the limits--of the laws of physics as we know them today. He ranks the impossible technologies by categories--Class I, II, and III, depending on when they might be achieved, within the next century, millennia, or perhaps never. In a compelling and thought-provoking narrative, he explains: * How the science of optics and electromagnetism may one day enable us to bend light around an object, like a stream flowing around a boulder, making the object invisible to observers "downstream" * How ramjet rockets, laser sails, antimatter engines, and nanorockets may one day take us to the nearby stars * How telepathy and psychokinesis, once considered pseudoscience, may one day be possible using advances in MRI, computers, superconductivity, and nanotechnology * Why a time machine is apparently consistent with the known laws of quantum physics, although it would take an unbelievably advanced civilization to actually build one Kaku uses his discussion of each technology as a jumping-off point to explain the science behind it. An extraordinary scientific adventure, Physics of the Impossible takes readers on an unforgettable, mesmerizing journey into the world of science that both enlightens and entertains.	The Physics of Star TrekWhat exactly "warps" when you are traveling at warp speed? What is the difference between the holodeck and a hologram? What happens when you get beamed up? Are time loops really possible, and can I kill my grandmother before I was born? Until now, fans of "Star Trek" were hard pressed to find answers to vital questions such as these. Now Lawrence M. Krauss, an internationally known theoretical physicist and educator, has written the quintessential physics book for Trekkers and non-Trekkers alike. Anyone who has ever wondered, "Could this really happen?" will gain useful insights into the "Star Trek" universe (and, incidentally, the real universe) in this charming and accessible volume. Krauss boldly goes where "Star Trek" has gone -- and beyond. He uses the "Star Trek" future as a launching pad to discuss the forefront of modern physics. From Newton to Hawking, from Einstein to Feynman, from Kirk to Janeway, Krauss leads the reader on a voyage to the world of physics as we now know it and as it might one day be. Featuring the Top 10 biggest physics bloopers in "Star Trek," as selected by Nobel Prize-winning physicists and other dedicated Trekkers!"This book is fun, and Mr. Krauss has a nice touch with a tough subject...Readers drawn by frivolity will be treated to substance." "--New York Times Book Review" "Today's science fiction is often tomorrow's science fact. The physics that underlies "Star Trek" is surely worth investigating. To confine our attention to terrestrial matters would be to limit the human spirit."--Stephen Hawking (in the foreword)A	Quantum: Einstein, Bohr and the Great Debate About the Nature of RealityFor most people, quantum theory is a byword for mysterious, impenetrable science. And yet for many years it was equally baffling for scientists themselves. Manjit Kumar gives a dramatic and superbly-written history of this fundamental scientific revolution, and the divisive debate at its heart. For 60 years most physicists believed that quantum theory denied the very existence of reality itself. Yet Kumar shows how the golden age of physics ignited the greatest intellectual debate of the twentieth century. Quantum sets the science in the context of the great upheavals of the modern age. In 1925 the quantum pioneers nearly all hailed from upper-middle-class academic families; most were German; and their average age was 24. But it was their irrational, romantic spirit, formed in reaction to the mechanised slaughter of the First World War that inspired their will to test science to its limits. The essential read for anyone fascinated by this complex and thrilling story and by the band of young men at its heart.	QED: The Strange Theory of Light and MatterFamous the world over for the creative brilliance of his insights into the physical world, Nobel Prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman also possessed an extraordinary talent for explaining difficult concepts to the nonscientist. QED--the edited version of four lectures on quantum electrodynamics that Feynman gave to the general public at UCLA as part of the Alix G. Mautner Memorial Lecture series--is perhaps the best example of his ability to communicate both the substance and the spirit of science to the layperson. The focus, as the title suggests, is quantum electrodynamics (QED), the part of the quantum theory of fields that describes the interactions of the quanta of the electromagnetic field-light, X rays, gamma rays--with matter and those of charged particles with one another. By extending the formalism developed by Dirac in 1933, which related quantum and classical descriptions of the motion of particles, Feynman revolutionized the quantum mechanical understanding of the nature of particles and waves. And, by incorporating his own readily visualizable formulation of quantum mechanics, Feynman created a diagrammatic version of QED that made calculations much simpler and also provided visual insights into the mechanisms of quantum electrodynamic processes. In this book, using everyday language, spatial concepts, visualizations, and his renowned "Feynman diagrams" instead of advanced mathematics, Feynman successfully provides a definitive introduction to QED for a lay readership without any distortion of the basic science. Characterized by Feynman's famously original clarity and humor, this popular book on QED has not been equaled since its publication.	In Search of the MultiverseJohn Gribbin's In Search of the Multiverse takes us on an extraordinary journey through the most fundamental questions in science, exploring the frontiers of reality itself. What are the boundaries of our universe? Could there be other worlds - do we actually live in a multiverse? Will we meet another 'us' in a different reality? Or are alternative worlds parallel but separate? John Gribbin guides us through the different theories about multiverses, along the way explaining the every latest thinking about gravity, about time and multiple dimensions, about quantum theory, about matter itself - and even the mind-bending possibility that one day we may be creating universes ourselves. John Gribbin is the best guide to the big questions of science. And there is no bigger question than our search for the multiverse. 'The master of popular science writing' Sunday Times 'In this universe at least, it's brilliant' BBC Focus 'Numerous books on the subject have appeared in the past few years, but Gribbin's stands out for succinctness and readability. Long renowned as one of Britain's finest popular science writers, Gribbin combines expert knowledge with straightforward, no-frills exposition' Scotland on Sunday John Gribbin is one of today's greatest writers of popular science and the author of bestselling books, including In Search of Schrodinger's Cat, Stardust, Science: A History and Deep Simplicity. Gribbin trained as an astrophysicist at Cambridge University and is currently Visiting Fellow in Astronomy at the University of Sussex.	The Ten Most Beautiful ExperimentsFrom the acclaimed New York Timesscience writer George Johnson, an irresistible book on the ten most fascinating experiments in the history of science--moments when a curious soul posed a particularly eloquent question to nature and received a crisp, unambiguous reply. Johnson takes us to those times when the world seemed filled with mysterious forces, when scientists were dazzled by light, by electricity, and by the beating of the hearts they laid bare on the dissecting table. We see Galileo singing to mark time as he measures the pull of gravity, and Newton carefully inserting a needle behind his eye to learn how light causes vibrations in the retina. William Harvey ties a tourniquet around his arm and watches his arteries throb above and his veins bulge below, proving that blood circulates. Luigi Galvani sparks electrical currents in dissected frog legs, wondering at the twitching muscle fibers, and Ivan Pavlov makes his now-famous dogs salivate at ascending chord progressions. For all of them, diligence was rewarded. In an instant, confusion was swept aside and something new about nature leaped into view. In bringing us these stories, Johnson restores some of the romance to science, reminding us of the existential excitement of a single soul staring down the unknown.	5915	4240	2091	4137	2287	155080	58747	303	71	758\$\$The Black Hole War: My Battle with Stephen Hawking to Make the World Safe for Quantum MechanicsWhat happens when something is sucked into a black hole? Does it disappear? Three decades ago, a young physicist named Stephen Hawking claimed it did-and in doing so put at risk everything we know about physics and the fundamental laws of the universe. Most scientists didn't recognize the import of Hawking's claims, but Leonard Susskind and Gerard t'Hooft realized the threat, and responded with a counterattack that changed the course of physics. THE BLACK HOLE WAR is the thrilling story of their united effort to reconcile Hawking's revolutionary theories of black holes with their own sense of reality-effort that would eventually result in Hawking admitting he was wrong, paying up, and Susskind and t'Hooft realizing that our world is a hologram projected from the outer boundaries of space. A brilliant book about modern physics, quantum mechanics, the fate of stars and the deep mysteries of black holes, Leonard Susskind's account of the Black Hole War is mind-bending and exhilarating reading.	Three Roads To Quantum Gravity"It would be hard to imagine a better guide to this difficult subject."--Scientific American In Three Roads to Quantum Gravity, Lee Smolin provides an accessible overview of the attempts to build a final "theory of everything." He explains in simple terms what scientists are talking about when they say the world is made from exotic entities such as loops, strings, and black holes and tells the fascinating stories behind these discoveries: the rivalries, epiphanies, and intrigues he witnessed firsthand. "Provocative, original, and unsettling." -The New York Review of Books "An excellent writer, a creative thinker."-Nature	Endless Universe: Beyond the Big BangTwo world-renowned scientists present an audacious new vision of the cosmos that "steals the thunder from the Big Bang theory." --Wall Street Journal The Big Bang theory--widely regarded as the leading explanation for the origin of the universe--posits that space and time sprang into being about 14 billion years ago in a hot, expanding fireball of nearly infinite density. Over the last three decades the theory has been repeatedly revised to address such issues as how galaxies and stars first formed and why the expansion of the universe is speeding up today. Furthermore, an explanation has yet to be found for what caused the Big Bang in the first place. In Endless Universe, Paul J. Steinhardt and Neil Turok, both distinguished theoretical physicists, present a bold new cosmology. Steinhardt and Turok "contend that what we think of as the moment of creation was simply part of an infinite cycle of titanic collisions between our universe and a parallel world" (Discover). They recount the remarkable developments in astronomy, particle physics, and superstring theory that form the basis for their groundbreaking "Cyclic Universe" theory. According to this theory, the Big Bang was not the beginning of time but the bridge to a past filled with endlessly repeating cycles of evolution, each accompanied by the creation of new matter and the formation of new galaxies, stars, and planets. Endless Universeprovides answers to longstanding problems with the Big Bang model, while offering a provocative new view of both the past and the future of the cosmos. It is a "theory that could solve the cosmic mystery" (USA Today).	The 4 Percent Universe: Dark Matter, Dark Energy, and the Race to Discover the Rest of RealityThe epic, behind-the-scenes story of an astounding gap in our scientific knowledge of the cosmos. In the past few years, a handful of scientists have been in a race to explain a disturbing aspect of our universe: only 4 percent of it consists of the matter that makes up you, me, our books, and every planet, star, and galaxy. The rest--96 percent of the universe--is completely unknown. Richard Panek tells the dramatic story of how scientists reached this conclusion, and what they're doing to find this "dark" matter and an even more bizarre substance called dark energy. Based on in-depth, on-site reporting and hundreds of interviews--with everyone from Berkeley's feisty Saul Perlmutter and Johns Hopkins's meticulous Adam Riess to the quietly revolutionary Vera Rubin--the book offers an intimate portrait of the bitter rivalries and fruitful collaborations, the eureka moments and blind alleys, that have fueled their search, redefined science, and reinvented the universe.	Black Holes & Time Warps: Einstein's Outrageous LegacyEver since Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity burst upon the world in 1915 some of the most brilliant minds of our century have sought to decipher the mysteries bequeathed by that theory, a legacy so unthinkable in some respects that even Einstein himself rejected them. Which of these bizarre phenomena, if any, can really exist in our universe? Black holes, down which anything can fall but from which nothing can return; wormholes, short spacewarps connecting regions of the cosmos; singularities, where space and time are so violently warped that time ceases to exist and space becomes a kind of foam; gravitational waves, which carry symphonic accounts of collisions of black holes billions of years ago; and time machines, for traveling backward and forward in time. Kip Thorne, along with fellow theorists Stephen Hawking and Roger Penrose, a cadre of Russians, and earlier scientists such as Oppenheimer, Wheeler and Chandrasekhar, has been in the thick of the quest to secure answers. In this masterfully written and brilliantly informed work of scientific history and explanation, Dr. Thorne, the Feynman Professor of Theoretical Physics at Caltech, leads his readers through an elegant, always human, tapestry of interlocking themes, coming finally to a uniquely informed answer to the great question: what principles control our universe and why do physicists think they know the things they think they know? Stephen Hawking's A Brief History of Timehas been one of the greatest best-sellers in publishing history. Anyone who struggled with that book will find here a more slowly paced but equally mind-stretching experience, with the added fascination of a rich historical and human component.

Now the New York Timesbestselling author who's built a reputation for keeping her readers' pulse in the red zone delivers a thriller that will stun the senses -- all six of them. This time a psychic special agent and a gritty cop must stop a brutal killer with a chilling M.O. and an unstoppable...Sense of Evil. The victims are always the same: beautiful, successful, and blond. Someone was able to coax these intelligent and confident women away from safety. Someone was able to gain their trust long enough to do the unthinkable. Their shocking murders have terrified the inhabitants of a small, peaceful town where such heinous crimes are simply not supposed to happen. Police Chief Rafe Sullivan knows he has to find answers fast before another woman is lured to her death -- but Sullivan literally doesn't have a clue. And when the FBI sends one of their top profilers to help, he's more than a little surprised that his new partner is nothing like the straight-by-the-book "suit" he expects. Special Agent Isabel Adams is tough, fearless, determined, and every bit Sullivan's equal. She's also psychic. And blond. Skeptical of his new partner's ability to get inside the mind of a killer, Sullivan can't deny that Isabel has tuned in to the killer's wavelength, and is following the twisted thoughts of a murderer obsessed with stalking, seduction, and death. But in getting so close, Isabel has set herself up as the next victim. Now, with time running out, she and Rafe will find themselves forced to take the greatest risk of all, because this psychopath is playing for keeps and Isabel is the perfect trophy. Unable to turn back, Isabel may have already gone too far. Smart, savvy, and confident, she may find that the very qualities that have kept her alive could turn out to be her undoing. For Isabel has entered the world of a cold-blooded monster who kills without mercy and eludes every sense but one... the sense of evil.	Cold Touch (Extrasensory Agents, #2)Since being gifted--or cursed--with her ability to touch a lifeless body and relive the victim's final moments, Olivia Wainwright has died a hundred deaths. She hears the screams, tastes the fear; feels the excruciating pain--and every glimpse into this darkness draws her deeper into danger. Now, though, she's met a man who offers a glimmer of light. Savannah Detective Gabe Cooper might look like a sexy good-old-boy, but his laid-back attitude hides a sharp mind and a protective heart. He doesn't believe in psychics--until he meets Olivia and sees firsthand how her dark gift ravages her spirit. As their bond deepens, Olivia will have to choose between her cold gift and the warmth Gabe provides. But her past is catching up with her, and Gabe can't refuse when she needs his help solving a crime that's haunted her for over a decade...her own murder.	The Kill (Predator Trilogy, #3)Her worst nightmare brought back to life, she risks everything for a second shot at justice. For thirty years, FBI scientist Olivia St. Martin has lived with guilt and one abiding certainty-that while she wasn't able to save her sister's life, she did testify and helped to convict the rapist and killer. When shocking new evidence exonerates the man Olivia is sure she saw abduct her sister, she breaks every rule in the book to uncover the truth. Driven by the possibility that she put the wrong man behind bars, Olivia discovers that a serial killer has been at large all these years.

Dead Man's Cell Phone"Satire is her oxygen. . . . In her new oddball comedy, Dead Man's Cell Phone, Sarah Ruhl is forever vital in her lyrical and biting takes on how we behave."--The Washington Post "Ruhl's zany probe of the razor-thin line between life and death delivers a fresh and humorous look at the times we live in."--Variety "Sarah Ruhl is deliriously imaginative and fearless in her choice of subject matter. She is an original."--Molly Smith, artistic director, Arena Stage An incessantly ringing cell phone in a quiet cafe. A stranger at the next table who has had enough. And a dead man--with a lot of loose ends. So begins Dead Man's Cell Phone, a wildly imaginative new comedy by playwright Sarah Ruhl, recipient of a MacArthur "Genius" Grant and Pulitzer Prize finalist for her play The Clean House. A work about how we memorialize the dead--and how that remembering changes us--it is the odyssey of a woman forced to confront her own assumptions about morality, redemption, and the need to connect in a technologically obsessed world. Sarah Ruhl's plays have been produced at theaters around the country, including Lincoln Center Theater, the Goodman Theatre, Arena Stage, South Coast Repertory, Yale Repertory Theatre, Berkeley Repertory Theatre, among others, and internationally. She is the recipient of the Susan Smith Blackburn Prize (for The Clean House, 2004), the Helen Merrill Emerging Playwrights Award, and the Whiting Writers' Award.

Time Stands StillIn his "absorbing intelligent" (Los Angeles Times) and timely new play, Donald Margulies uncovers the layers of a relationship between a photojournalist and foreign correspondent--once addicted to the adrenaline of documenting the atrocities of war, and now grounded in the couple's Brooklyn loft. Photographer Sarah was seriously injured while covering the war in Iraq; her reporter partner James had left weeks earlier, when the stress and horrors became too much for him. Now James writes online movie reviews while Sarah recovers, mourning for her Iraqi driver (and former lover) killed in the explosion, and itching to get back behind the camera. With this play--coming to Broadway this winter--Margulies revisits themes of being an artist, as characters ask: What does it mean to capture suffering on film, rather than stopping to intervene?

She goes to war with them, and blood is spilled.	2685	5940	6030	1348	6173	117236	-1	44711	-1	274\$\$Stop KissBen Brantley of the New York Times summed up the critical reaction to Diana Son's play Stop Kiss when he stated that it "generated the warmest advance word of mouth of any downtown production this season" and heralded it as a Barefoot in the Park for a new generation. Son's story is deceptively simple: two young women in New York meet, talk about their boyfriends, feel a growing, unspoken attraction for each other, and finally kiss. And that one innocent kiss sets off a savage gay-bashing. But even as Stop Kiss confronts the reality of physical violence, Son's imaginative, moving, and surprising comedy brings audiences -- and her principal characters -- to unexpected places.Callie is holding down a job as a radio traffic reporter when she meets Sara, a midwesterner who, against her parents' wishes, has moved to the city to teach third-grade students in the Bronx. Both have boyfriends, but as they get to know each other, their shared experiences and sense of humor create a strong bond. The tragic consequences of their kiss -- the center of this powerful drama -- serve as both an indictment of hatred and a moving study of the perils inherent in living life fully.	QuillsThe play recounts the imagined final days in the life of the Marquis de Sade. Quills premiered at Washington, D.C.'s Woolly Mammoth Theatre Company in 1995 and subsequently had its debut Off-Broadway at New York Theatre Workshop. Quills garnered the 1995 Kesselring Prize for Best New American Play from the National Arts Club and, for Wright, a 1996 Village Voice Obie Award for Outstanding Achievement in Playwriting.	Fuddy Meers	The Shape of ThingsA startling dissection of cruelty and artistic creation from the author of In the Company of Menand Your Friends and Neighbors In a modern version of Adam's seduction by Eve, The Shape of Thingspits gentle, awkward, overweight Adam against experienced, analytical, amoral Evelyn, a graduate student in art. After a chance meeting at a museum, Evelyn and Adam embark on an intense relationship that causes shy and principled Adam to go to extraordinary lengths, including cosmetic surgery, and a betrayal of his best friend, to improve his appearance and character. In the process, Evelyn's subtle and insistent coaching results in a reconstruction of Adam's fundamental moral character. Only in a final and shocking exhibition does Evelyn reveal the nature of her interest in Adam, of her detached artist's perspective and sense of authority--to her, Adam is no more than "flesh.... one of the most perfect materials on earth. Natural, beautiful, and malleable." Labute's latest work is an intense and disturbing study not only of the uses of power within human relationships, but also of the ethics involved in the relationship of art and life. To what extent is an artist licensed to shape and change her medium or to alter the work of another artist? What is acceptable artistic material? At what point does creation become manipulation, and at what point does creation destroy? Or, is the new Adam, handsome and confident if heart broken, an admirable result of the most challenging artistic endeavor? The Shape of Thingschallenges society's most deeply entrenched ideas about art, manipulation, and love.	Uncommon Women and Others	In the Next Room, or the vibrator playIn the Next Room or the vibrator playis a comedy about marriage, intimacy, and electricity. Set in the 1880s at the dawn of the age of electricity and based on the bizarre historical fact that doctors used vibrators to treat 'hysterical' women (and some men), the play centers on a doctor and his wife and how his new therapy affects their entire household. In a seemingly perfect, well-to-do Victorian home, proper gentleman and scientist Dr. Givings has innocently invented an extraordinary new device for treating "hysteria" in women (and occasionally men): the vibrator. Adjacent to the doctor's laboratory, his young and energetic wife tries to tend to their newborn daughter-and wonders exactly what is going on in the next room. When a new "hysterical" patient and her husband bring a wet nurse and their own complicated relationship into the doctor's home, Dr. and Mrs. Givings must examine the nature of their own marriage, and what it truly means to love someone. This laugh out loud, provocative and touching play premiered at Berkely Rep and subsequently marked Sarah Ruhl's Broadway debut opening at the Lyceum Theatre on November 19th, 2009.	2685	6030	1720	6173	1348	97409	-1	59503	-1	274
The Battle Of LifeThe Battle of Life: A Love Story is a novella by Charles Dickens, 1st published in 1846. It's the 4th of his five "Christmas Books", coming after The Cricket on the Hearth, followed by The Haunted Man & the Ghost's Bargain. The setting is an English village that stands on the site of a historic battle. Some characters refer to the battle as a metaphor for the struggles of life, hence the title. Battle is the only one of the five Christmas Books that has no supernatural or explicitly religious elements. (One scene takes place at Christmas time, but it isn't the final scene.) The story bears some resemblance to The Cricket on the Hearth in two aspects: it has a non-urban setting & it's resolved with a romantic twist. It's even less of a social novel than is Cricket. As is typical with Dickens, the ending is a happy one. It's one of Dickens' lesser-known works & has never attained any high level of popularity, a trait it shares among the Christmas Books with The Haunted Man.	La Navidad en las montañas	Cousin HenryCousin Henry, first published in 1879, is perhaps the most unusual and intriguing of Trollope's shorter novels. Trollope's masterly handling of the novel's unlikely hero, a tiresome and timid coward, is notable for its insight and compassion.	Lord Tony's WifeLord Tony's Wife is a sequel book to the classic adventure tale, The Scarlet Pimpernel. Plot summary: The year is 1789 and Pierre Adet, a young French peasant, is incensed at the unfair treatment of the local peasantry, who are no more better off than slaves to the local aristo. His brother-in-law is about to be hanged for poaching two pigeons from the woods belonging to the Duc de Kernogan in Nantes and this proves the final straw. After months of planning Pierre leads a mob against the Duc against the advice of his father. Before the mob have had the chance to storm the Chateau, they come across the Duc's daughter Yvonne returning home and attack her carriage. In the ensuing scuffle, Adet assaults Yvonne 'And just to punish you, my fine lady, ' he said in a whisper which sent a shudder of horror right through her, 'to punish you for what you are, the brood of tyrants, proud, disdainful, a budding tyrant yourself, to punish you for every misery my mother and sister have had to endure, for every luxury which you have enjoyed, I will kiss you on the lips and the cheeks and just between your white throat and chin and never as long as you live if you die this night or live to be an hundred will you be able to wash off those kisses showered upon you by one who hates and loathes you --a miserable peasant whom you despise and who in your sight is lower far than your dogs.' Shortly afterwards the Duc's private army arrive and dispatch the mob. Adet is seriously injured and seeks refuge from a local priest before fleeing Nantes and the death sentence which has been passed on him. Determined that someone must pay for the incident, the Duc de Kernogan ensures that Pierre's father is hanged for his son's crime. By the time Pierre finds out it is too late and he is driven to seek revenge against the Duc and his daughter. It's now 1793 and Adet is living in England under the alias of Martin-Roget. He has spent the intervening years educating himself and with the aid of an introductory letter, obtained by blackmailing the Bishop of Brest, has ingratiated himself into English society -- to the extent that he has gained the favour of the Duc de Kernogan (who is now living near Bath) and is Yvonne's favoured suitor. Needless to say, both Yvonne and her father are ignorant of Martin-Roget's true identity and are unaware that he is seeking revenge. With the help of Chauvelin, he plans to marry Yvonne and lure her and the Duc back to Nantes and to their death as ci-devants on the guillotine. Adet's plans suffer a setback when he discovers that, warned by Sir Percy that she is at risk from Martin-Roget, Yvonne has eloped with Lord Antony Dewhurst. The Duc, believing that Martin-Roget is a millionaire banker whose marriage to Yvonne would have resulted in substantial funds being given to the French royalist cause, is furious that his plans have been thwarted and refuses to recognise the marriage, which would not be legal in France due to Yvonne's age. Martin-Roget convinces the Duc that he still wishes to marry Yvonne and soon persuade him to lure Yvonne away from Lord Tony. He then kidnaps her and the three set off for France. Lord Tony must seek the help of The Scarlet Pimpernel to save his wife. (wikipedia.org)	InnkeeperOnly two weeks from His crucifixion, Jesus has stopped in Bethlehem. He has returned to visit someone important--the innkeeper who made a place for Mary and Joseph the night He was born. But His greater purpose in coming is to pay a debt.

The story of an innkeeper whose life was forever altered by the arrival of the Son of God. Ponder the sacrifice that was made that night. Celebrate Christ's birth and the power of His resurrection.

This book has been restored and reprinted from the 1886 edition. It is a high quality reproduction that retains the typesetting and illustrations of the original, which adds to the charming antique feel of the book.

With her gift of 'Second Sight', Clara foresees terrible tragedy ahead and is racked by guilt. Allied to two different ships, the two men at first have no cause to meet -- until disaster strikes and they find themselves united in a battle for survival. It cannot be long before they discover the nature of their rivalry, and the hot-tempered Wardour must choose how to take his revenge. Based on the doomed 1845 expedition to the Arctic, and originally performed as a play starring both Collins and Dickens, 'The Frozen Deep' is a dramatic tale of vengeance and self-sacrifice which went on to inspire the character of Sydney Carton in Charles Dickens' 'A Tale of Two Cities'. NB: This is a separate work by Wilkie Collins It is a novel, published serially in 'Temple Bar' between August and October 1874 and then published as a book, and is not the play of the same name that Charles Dickens and Wilkie Collins collaborated on in 1856 and that they both appeared in and that was subsequently published in 1857.	AfterwardOr, rather, Ned answered, in the same strain, "why, amid so much that's ghostly, it can never affirm its separate existence as THE ghost." And thereupon their invisible housemate had finally dropped out of their references, which were numerous enough to make them promptly unaware of the loss.	The Waverly Novels: The BetrothedThe Betrothed is the first of two Tales of the Crusaders. The action takes place in the Welsh Marches during the latter part of the reign of Henry II, after 1187. Eveline, the 16-year-old daughter of Sir Raymond Berenger, is rescued from a Welsh siege by the forces of Damian Lacy. She is betrothed to his uncle, Sir Hugo, who leaves on a crusade. Rebels led by Ranald Lacy attempt to kidnap her, and Damian fights them off, but a confused sequence of events convinces the King that she and her beloved are in league against him.	Aurora FloydLike Lady Audley, Aurora is a beautiful young woman bigamously married and threatened with exposure by a blackmailer. But in Aurora Floyd, and in many of the novels written in imitation of it, bigamy is little more than a euphemism, a device to enable the heroine, and vicariously the reader, to enjoy the forbidden sweets of adultery without adulterous intentions.	The Haunted ManIn this story, Dickens narrates the hair-raising experiences of a professor. As the protagonist dwells on his past sorrows and mistakes, a phantom visits him. It offers him a bizarre escape from painful recollections of yesteryear by offering to eradicate his memory. On seeing the professor turn into a man devoid of emotions, the reader realizes how empty one becomes without a past.	Mr. Harrison's ConfessionsThis charming and witty prequel to Cranfordis a neglected Gaskell classic with all the period detail, distinctively drawn characters, and a well-knitted plot associated with her works Enjoying the comforts of his well-kept home, country doctor William Harrison is prevailed upon by his longtime friend Charles, a bachelor, to dispense some advice on the "wooing and winning" of women's affections. So begins the fascinating and varied recollections of one of Gaskell's best-loved characters. Lured to rural Duncombe by the promise of a partnership in a country practice, William finds himself trapped in claustrophobic provincial life where society is apparently presided over by the scheming of a set of under-occupied middle-aged women. Their supposed matchmaking prowess in fact leaves much to be desired; so much so, indeed, that before long the hapless young physician finds himself betrothed to three women--none of whom is the beautiful Sophy, the woman he truly desires. Chaotic, hilarious, and poignant, this comedy of manners--and of errors--will resonate with Gaskell aficionados and newcomers alike.	3924	2990	2685	909	5473	30120	-1	40290	71	274

Daughter of ChaosReviews: "At the beginning, this novel is reminiscent of other popular fantasy novels like the Harry Potter series by J. K. Rowling and the Percy Jackson series by Rick Riordan, but it quickly takes on a life of its own that will appeal to science fiction, fantasy, and young adult fans alike. Darlena's struggles mirror issues that many teens face, making her a relatable and likable main character. This is a title with wide appeal that will fly off the shelves."--Elisabeth W. Rauch, VOYA Magazine "You must choose, child. Choose now, and choose once, for once taken, the path becomes your fate."

Darlena isn't expecting the form it takes, though. Hecate, the goddess of witchcraft, shows up in her living room and pressures her to choose her path, and Lena does something stupid; she declares that she'll be a Red Witch, something that doesn't exist...or does it? Now Lena's on the run, struggling to master the forces of chaos she now controls while at the same time staying out of the way of the crazy gods and goddesses who want her to use Red Magic to cause chaos. Turns out, Red Magic is real...and deadly. Will Lena learn enough about her power before it's too late, or will she become a walking disaster?

Hembusan angin terasa keras menerpa ujung telingaku, dingin merayap di sekujur tubuhku. Aku menoleh ke belakang. Seketika aku terperanjat, hampir tak percaya pada penglihatanku sendiri. Sebaris lantai keramik di depan pintu kamar utama kulihat bergerak-gerak pelan membentuk gelombang, seperti ombak laut yang mengalun di sebuah pantai. Seolah ada sesuatu yang hendak keluar dari bawah lantai keramik itu. Kucubit lenganku untuk meyakinkan bahwa aku tidak sedang bermimpi, berharap ini hanya halusinasiku saja. Tanganku terasa sakit, dan ini memang bukanlah mimpi. Ini nyata! Kenyataan yang ada di depan mata kepalaku sendiri! Kenyataan yang tak bisa kuhindari. Dengan memberanikan diri, kudekati keramik yang masih bergerak-gerak pelan lalu kutepuk dengan telapak tangan kiriku. "Preeekkk....." Keramik-keramik itu berhenti bergerak, tetapi tiga buah keramik terlepas dari posisinya semula. Beberapa keramik di sebelah tiga keramik yang terlepas itu tak lagi melekat kuat pada semen di bawahnya, hingga dengan gerakan kecilku saja dapat kulepas satu per satu. Keramik-keramik itu kusingkirkan ke pinggir tembok, dan kini lekuk bekasnya yang terbuka itu tampak memanjang, seukuran tubuh orang dewasa. Lama aku berdiri terpaku melihat keanehan itu. Tiba-tiba tengkukku serasa ditiup, dan kusadari kini bahwa bentuk longkapan bekas keramik itu menyerupai sebuah makam. MENYERUPAI SEBUAH MAKAM! Tanganku tiba-tiba bergetar, dingin oleh hembusan angin yang seketika menyeruak. Aku tak kuasa menahan getar dingin ditubuhku, ngilu pada tulang-tulangku. Rasa takut menyergapku. Dengan berjingkat kubuka pintu kamar utama dan kudapati istriku masih pulas bersama Pijar anakku. Kuambil kembali keramik-keramik yang telah terlepas dan kututup lagi pada tempatnya semula. Aku tak ingin istriku merasa ngeri melihat longkapan sebaris keramik yang meyerupai makam. "Pak..." Aku terkesiap. Bu Darmi sudah berdiri di belakangku. Dia tampak aneh memperhatikan lantai keramik yang baru saja kurapikan. "Oh, Bu Darmi." Aku tergeragap. "Sejak kapan ibu berdiri di situ?" Kutatap mata Bu Darmi. Aku merasa kurang senang dengan kedatangannya yang telah mengejutkanku. "Maaf pak," Bu Darmi menundukkan mukanya. "Ibu nggak tidur?" "Saya mau ke kamar kecil pak." "Oh, silakan bu." Bu Darmi buru-buru melangkah ke kamar kecil. Sepertinya Bu Darmi ketakutan. Aneh sekali sikapnya tadi.	Dark MasquesLOOK BEHIND THE MASQUES--IF YOU DARE...

Realidad daimonicaLos fenomenos paranormales nunca han sido temas respetables para los portavoces oficiales de nuestra cultura, ya sean cientificos, academicos, prensa seria o representantes de la Iglesia. El trato que siempre han recibido por parte de la cultura oficial contrasta vivamente con la continua atencion obtenida en la cultura popular, que ha tratado de explicarlos con todo tipo de teorias extravagantes, sensacionalistas y pseudocientificas. Patrick Harpur reprueba estas dos actitudes. La primera, por esquiva, al eludir las preguntas que, a su juicio, deberian suscitar tales fenomenos sobre la naturaleza de la realidad y de la mente; la segunda, por ingenua, al tomar estas apariciones en su sentido literal. Para Harpur se trata de fenomenos puramente psiquicos; pero la <>es el mundo, no solo nuestras mentes individuales. De esta manera, todos los seres fantasticos que han aparecido a lo largo de la historia -hadas, daimones, divinidades, animales, fantasmas, damas blancas, enanos, Yetis, ovnis, etc.- pertenecen a la esfera de la Imaginacion o, como denominaron los neoplatonicos, <>. El error, dice Harpur, es negar y reprimir estas manifestaciones, pues cuanto mas se reprimen, mas patologicamente retornan. Tanto Realidad daimonicacomo El fuego secreto de los filosofosconstituyen una de las aportaciones mas coherentes y lucidas de estos ultimos anos sobre el inefable mundo de la Imaginacion.

Recently, this effort was extended to try to include the inner world of human beings. Gary Lachman argues that this view of consciousness is misguided and unfounded. He points to another approach to the study and exploration of consciousness that erupted into public awareness in the late 1800s. In this "secret history of consciousness," consciousness is seen not as a result of neurons and molecules, but as responsible for them; meaning is not imported from the outer world, but rather creates it. In this view, consciousness is a living, evolving presence whose development can be traced through different historical periods, and which evolves along a path to a broader, more expansive state. What that consciousness may be like and how it may be achieved is a major concern of this book . Lachman concentrates on the period since the late 1800s, when Madame Blavatsky first brought the secret history out into the open. As this history unfolds, we encounter the ideas of many modern thinkers, from esotericists like P. D. Ouspensky, Rudolf Steiner, and Colin Wilson to more mainstream philosophers like Henri Bergson, William James, Owen Barfield and the psychologist Andreas Mavromatis. Two little known but important thinkers play a major role in his synthesis--Jurij Moskvitin, who showed how our consciousness relates to the mechanisms of perception and to the external world, and Jean Gebser, who presented perhaps the most impressive case for the evolution of consciousness. An important contribution to the study of consciousness ... a must-read. Contents:  Foreword by Colin Wilson Introduction: Consciousness Explained The Search for Cosmic Consciousness Esoteric Evolution The Archaeology of Consciousness Participatory Epistemology The Presence of Origin Last Words: Playing for Time Selected Bibliography "A marvelously exhilarating gallop through every important modern theory of consciousness, from Steiner to Maslow, from Bucke's 'cosmic consciousness' to Gebser's 'integral consciousness.'"--Colin Wilson, author of The Outsiderand Access to Inner Worlds "Opens up vast vistas of possibility, suggesting that what we experience as the earth may, in itself, be inseparable from our state of mind, and that the evolution of human consciousness may be as fundamental a process as our development through genetics. A must-read for those seeking an escape from our contemporary culture's cul-de-sac."--Daniel Pinchbeck, author of Breaking Open the Head "Thinking outside the box, Lachman challenges many contemporary theories by reinserting a sense of the spiritual back into the discussion. Profoundly erudite, yet easy to read, this book is a provocative mind-stretcher."--Leonard Shlainauthor of Art & Physics, Alphabet versus the Goddess, and Sex, Time & Power.	The Dark Sacrament: True Stories of Modern-Day Demon Possession and ExorcismIn The Dark Sacrament, co-authors David M. Kiely and Christina McKenna faithfully recount ten contemporary cases of demon possession, haunted houses, and exorcism, and profile the work of two living, active exorcists: Canon William Lendrum, a Protestant, and Father Ignatius McCarthy, a Roman Catholic.

Kiely and McKenna serve as trustworthy guides on this suspense-filled journey into the bizarre, offering concrete advice on how to avoid falling prey to the dark side. Exorcists Canon Lendrum and Father Ignatius reveal their fears, failings, and victories as they reflect on their forty years of service battling the Devil and his minions. The Dark Sacramentincludes the following chilling stories: A woman is tormented by her evil dead grandmother, causing her to coil like a snake, snarl, and be invaded by several demons. A housewife is haunted by the answers from her children playing on a Ouija board and by a historical character who sexually terrorizes her so much that she is too ashamed to admit it even to her husband. A young girl experiences astral travel when the Angel of Death enters her body and takes her along on a frightening journey. A boy's temperament turns dark as he is tortured by demons, causing him to become harmful to others--an unresolved 2007 case that is ongoing.

The Blind Man's GardenLove is not consolation, it is light.' From the author of Maps for Lost Loverscomes a searing, exquisitely written novel set in Pakistan and Afghanistan in the months following 9/11 - a story of war, of one family's losses, and of the simplest, most enduring human impulses. Jeo and Mikal, foster-brothers from a small Pakistani city, secretly enter Afghanistan: not to fight with the Taliban, but to help and care for wounded civilians. But it soon becomes apparent that good intentions can't keep them out of harm's way... From the wilds of Afghanistan to the heart of the family left behind - their blind father haunted for years by the death of his wife, by the mistakes he may have made in the name of Islam and nationhood, Jeo's steadfast wife and her superstitious mother - Aslam's prose takes us on an extraordinary journey.

A Bed of Red Flowers: In Search of My AfghanistanAs a young girl growing up in 1970s Afghanistan, Nelofer Pazira seems destined for a bright future. The daughter of liberal-minded professionals, she enjoys a safe, loving and privileged life. Some of her early memories include convivial family picnics and New Years' celebrations overlooking the thousands of red flowers that carpet the hills of Mazar. But Nelofer's world is shattered when she is just five and her father is imprisoned for refusing to support the communist party. This episode plants a "seed of anger" in her, which is given plenty of opportunity to grow as the years unfold. In 1979, the Soviets invade Afghanistan beginning a ten-year occupation. The country becomes an armed camp with Russians fighting U.S.-backed mujahidin fighters while trying to impose military rule. For Nelofer, daily life includes an endless succession of tanks, rockets screaming overhead and explosions in the street. During this time, she and her best friend, Dyana, seek refuge in their love of poetry. At eleven, the two girls throw stones at Soviet tanks and plot other acts of rebellion at the local school. As Nelofer gets older, she joins the resistance movement, distributes contraband books, studies guerilla warfare and hides a gun in her parent's mint garden. When Nelofer's younger brother comes home from school in military garb, the family finally decides to flee Afghanistan. What follows is a perilous, clandestine journey across rugged mountains into Pakistan. But the life of a refugee is not what Nelofer expects. Though she once idealized the mujahidin as freedom fighters, she is shocked, as a woman, to find herself stripped of her personal freedom in their midst. In 1990, Nelofer and her family are offered refugee status in Canada. Here she corresponds with her friend Dyana, whose letters reveal the increasing oppression of life under the Taliban. Fearing that her friend will kill herself, Pazira returns to Afghanistan to rescue her. This search becomes the basis for the acclaimed film Kandahar. Her journey to discover Dyana's tragedy leads her finally to Russia, the land of her enemy, where she confronts the legacy of the Soviet invasion of her homeland first-hand. A Bed of Red Flowersis a gripping, heart-rending story about a country caught in a struggle of the superpowers - and of the real people behind the politics. Universally acclaimed for its astute insights and extraordinary humanity, Pazira's memoir won the Drainie-Taylor Biography Prize for 2005.The Winnipeg Free Presswrites: "Powerfully written, A Bed of Red Flowersis a rare account of a misunderstood country and its intrepid people, trying to live ordinary lives under extraordinary circumstances." The Gazette (Montreal) describes the book as "an outpouring of passionate non-fiction that captivates like the tales of Sheherazade.... It's a remarkable journey. An inspiring read."	The Magic of SaidaThe Magic of Saidatells the haunting story of Kamal, a successful Canadian doctor who, in middle age and after decades in North America, decides to return to his homeland of East Africa to find his childhood sweetheart, Saida. Kamal's journey is motivated by a combination of guilt, hope, and the desire to unravel the mysteries of his childhood--mysteries compounded by the fact that Kamal is the son of an absent Indian father from a well-to-do family and a Swahili African mother of slave ancestry. Through a series of flashbacks, we watch Kamal's early years in the ancient coastal town of Kilwa, where he grows up in a world of poverty but also of poetry, sustained by his friendship with the magical Saida. This world abruptly ends when Kamal is sent away by his mother to live with his father's family in the city. There, the academically gifted boy grows up as a "dark Indian," eventually going to university and departing for Canada. Left behind to her traditional fate is Saida, now a beautiful young woman. Decades later, Kamal's guilt pulls him back to Kilwa . . . where he discovers what happened to Saida during a harrowing night of sinister rites. This complex, revelatory, sweeping and shocking book, is a towering testament to the magical literary powers of M.G. Vassanji.	The Storyteller's Daughter: One Woman's Return to Her Lost HomelandThe vivid, often startling memoir of a young woman shaped by two dramatically disparate worlds. Saira Shah is the English-born daughter of an Afghan aristocrat, inspired by his dazzling stories to rediscover the now lost life their forebears presided over for nine hundred years within sight of the minarets and lush gardens of Kabul and the snow-topped mountains of the Hindu Kush.

Little Bastards In SpringtimeThe unflinching story of a boy who survives the siege of Sarajevo and immigrates to Toronto bearing the scars of war. It's Spring of 1992. Jevrem Andric is eleven years old, and brutal civil war is erupting in Sarajevo. At first it's just boring, as kids shut in apartments run out of ways to entertain themselves. A few weeks later, boredom is a luxury. Hell has arrived. They are trapped and face starvation and death. Jevrem's only comfort is his beloved grandmother, a tough World War II partisan who has seen everything there is to see in war. Five years later, what's left of his family has immigrated to Toronto, where spring feels like mid-winter, his grandmother is broken and ill, and sixteen-year-old Jevrem is on a rampage, drinking, doing drugs and breaking into houses with his small gang of Yugoslav friends. When his grandmother dies, he faces a moral reckoning that compels him to try, in his own warped way, to do some good in the world--the consequences be damned. Rudolph's voice is searing, tender and at times hallucinatory as she creates a brilliant portrait of a boy's fight for emotional survival and a family's attempt to find peace in a new land.	6209	5998	6585	710	964	1062	-1	24941	-1	274\$\$The Good MuslimFrom prizewinning Bangladeshi novelist Tahmima Anam comes her deeply moving second novel about the rise of Islamic radicalism in Bangladesh, seen through the intimate lens of a family. Pankaj Mishra praised A Golden Age, Tahmima Anam's debut novel, as a "startlingly accomplished and gripping novel that describes not only the tumult of a great historical event . . . but also the small but heroic struggles of individuals living in the shadow of revolution and war." In her new novel, The Good Muslim, Anam again deftly weaves the personal and the political, evoking with great skill and urgency the lasting ravages of war and the competing loyalties of love and belief. In the dying days of a brutal civil war, Sohail Haque stumbles upon an abandoned building. Inside he finds a young woman whose story will haunt him for a lifetime to come. . . . Almost a decade later, Sohail's sister, Maya, returns home after a long absence to find her beloved brother transformed. While Maya has stuck to her revolutionary ideals, Sohail has shunned his old life to become a charismatic religious leader. And when Sohail decides to send his son to a madrasa, the conflict between brother and sister comes to a devastating climax. Set in Bangladesh at a time when religious fundamentalism is on the rise, The Good Muslimis an epic story about faith, family, and the long shadow of war.	The Blind Man's GardenThe acclaimed author of The Wasted Vigil now gives us a searing, exquisitely written novel set in Pakistan and Afghanistan in the months following 9/11: a story of war, of one family's losses, and of the simplest, most enduring human impulses. Jeo and Mikal are foster brothers from a small town in Pakistan. Though they were inseparable as children, their adult lives have diverged: Jeo is a dedicated medical student, married a year; Mikal has been a vagabond since he was fifteen, in love with a woman he can't have. But when Jeo decides to sneak across the border into Afghanistan--not to fight with the Taliban against the Americans, rather to help care for wounded civilians--Mikal determines to go with him, to protect him. Yet Jeo's and Mikal's good intentions cannot keep them out of harm's way. As the narrative takes us from the wilds of Afghanistan to the heart of the family left behind--their blind father, haunted by the death of his wife and by the mistakes he may have made in the name of Islam and nationhood; Mikal's beloved brother and sister-in-law; Jeo's wife, whose increasing resolve helps keep the household running, and her superstitious mother--we see all of these lives upended by the turmoil of war. In language as lyrical as it is piercing, in scenes at once beautiful and harrowing, The Blind Man's Gardenunflinchingly describes a crucially contemporary yet timeless world in which the line between enemy and ally is indistinct, and where the desire to return home burns brightest of all.

Scenes from Early Life"At that time, there were children you weren't supposed to play with. You knew why. Their parents had been informers during the war. And it hadn't been long since you could have got into trouble for singing a song. My grandfather hid all his Bengali poetry in the cellar. "I was a baby during the war. We stayed inside for months. All my aunts took turns in feeding me. I couldn't be heard to cry. You see, there were soldiers in the streets. They would have known what a crying baby meant. So I had to be kept silent. No, not everyone came out of the war alive." One family's life, and a nation - Bangladesh - being created through conversation, sacrifice, songs, bonds, blood, bravery and jokes. Narrated by Philip Hensher's husband Zaved, 'Scenes from Early Life' is in part a memoir, part fiction and part a history of one of the most savage of twentieth-century civil wars. Heartbreaking, funny and gripping, it is a unique novel by one of our finest writers.	4013	710	5589	6585	1269	35717	-1	-1	5	-1

The Youth & Young Loves of Oliver Wade: StoriesWhat makes us who we are? Is it life's big milestones that propel us from childhood to adulthood? Or are we made of all the little memories that have a way of standing in for so much more? A green-eyed boy on a subway platform might be how you remember a breakthrough. A pair of worn corduroys might be what you remember of your first love. A coffee cup in a blizzard might be how you remember your best friend. The sound of a dial-up modem connecting. The wet stems of lily pads in your dad's hands. A spiral of hairs on a cheek. The outline of keys in a pocket. Blue paint under fingernails. Fireworks on a summer night. These details are like pulses, like heartbeat spikes on the cardiac line of memory. In the twelve stories in THE YOUTH & YOUNG LOVES OF OLIVER WADE, Ben Monopoli shows us these pulses in the life of our narrator Ollie as he grows from age thirteen to twenty-eight. Pulses that define who Ollie is, and ultimately who he'll become. A stand-alone companion to THE PAINTING OF PORCUPINE CITY and THE CRANBERRY HUSH.

Over more than three decades Adrienne Rich's essays have been praised for their lucidity, courage, and range of concerns. In A Human Eye, Rich examines a diverse selection of writings and their place in past and present social disorders and transformations. Beyond literary theories, she explores from many angles how the arts of language have acted on and been shaped by their creators' worlds. This powerful new collection includes a stirring response to the anthology Iraqi Poetry Today, a critique of three classic socialist manifestos, and a rereading of The Dead Lecturer, an early volume of poems by LeRoi Jones. Rich engages the impulse to make art that both impels toward and interacts with social change, a theme she also traces through the letters of poets Robert Duncan and Denise Levertov, gay and lesbian politics and poetry, and influential texts on Zionism and the Jewish diaspora.

The other is a Herculean Yankee captured by the rag-tag Confederate band and forced to become a martyr for all the sins of General Sheridan's fires. When these two find themselves admiring more than one another's spirit and demeanor, when passions erupt between captor and captive, will this new romance survive the arduous trek to Purgatory Mountain?	1350	1470	4953	2778	6260	78190	-1	29170	-1	-1

Never Burn a Witch (A Rowan Gant Investigation #2)In 1484, then Pope Innocent VIII issued a papal bull -- A decree giving the endorsement of the church to the inquisitors of the day who hunted, tortured, tried and ultimately murdered those accused of heresy -- especially the practice of WitchCraft.

Book of Shadows"Most people know intuitively that when you fall in love the world is full of magic. What they don't know is that when you discover the universe is full of magic, you fall in love with the world." When high-powered Manhattan lawyer Phyllis Curott began exploring Witchcraft, she discovered a spiritual movement that defied all stereotypes. Encountering neither satanic rites nor eccentric spinsters, she came to know a clandestine religion of the Goddess that had been forced into hiding over the course of history. Book of Shadows recounts Curott's remarkable initiation into Wicca (meaning "wise one") and shares her insights as a high priestess of an elegant, ancient spirituality that celebrates the magic of being alive. An Ivy-league graduate and promising lawyer, Curott was a typical young woman in her twenties, determined to forge a law career within the burgeoning, male-dominated music industry. But when she began having prophetic dreams and mysterious visions of ancient female figures and unfamiliar symbols, she discovered an unexpected world of magic and began searching for a rational explanation. When her friend Sophia--a practicing Witch--suggested having her cards read by a Wiccan High Priestess, Curott instinctively dismissed the idea, but then forced her natural skepticism aside on the chance that this age-old practice might help her understand the unusual occurrences in her life. Thus begins her journey into the magical world of Witchcraft, a religion originally practiced by priestesses, shamans, and healers that empowers our lives by working with the natural cycles of nature. Fascinated by this pre-Judeo-Christian religion that honors women as the embodiment of the Goddess and emphasizes respect and love for the natural world, Curott began attending a local coven's weekly circle to learn the sacred arts. Her Book of Shadows chronicles her ascent to the position of Wiccan High Priestess and her efforts to reconcile her newfound spirituality with her struggles as a woman rising through the ranks of the corporate world. Along the way, Curott relates the history of Witchcraft and shares many traditional Wiccan practices, such as casting a circle, drawing down the Goddess, harnessing the powers of the natural world, and casting spells for health, prosperity, and love. Engagingly written and rich with detailed rituals and techniques, this inspirational book traces a modern woman's spiritual journey into a realm of extraordinary experience and enlightenment. Book of Shadows provides us with the keys to discover an enchanted world of divine empowerment so as to unlock the power that lies within us all	Sons of the Goddess: A Young Man's Guide to Wicca2006 COVR Awards Book of the Year  Wicca 101 for young men.

Homage to CataloniaOrwell's personal account of his experiences and observations in the Spanish Civil War.	Memoirs of a RevolutionaryVictor Serge (1890-1947) was an anarchist who initially supported the Russian Revolution. More important, he was also a writer of rare integrity, who left behind a remarkable eyewitness record in fiction, journalism, and above all his masterwork, Memoirs of a Revolutionary. In it he tells the story of how the Russian Revolution unfolded, swept up an entire nation, and eventually failed.The book begins in 1906, with Serge describing his impoverished, idealistic days as an activist in the left-wing movements of Europe; it ends with the years 1936 to 1941 after his release from exile to a remote city in a time of famine, expulsion from the Soviet Union, escape from Nazi agents in Paris, and flight to Mexico as a political refugee. More than a personal memoir, this insider's history of the revolution and its allied upheavals fills in the human details that add to our understanding of how mass movements take place, how governments stand and fall, how individuals survive in struggles between ideologies. It is a human memoir and, though set in an inhumane time, during a clash among powerful ideals, it is a humane memoir.	The Spanish Civil WarSince its first publication, 'The Spanish Civil War' has become established as the definitive one-volume history of a conflict that continues to provoke intense controversy. What was it that roused left-wing sympathizers from over the world to fight again	Free Women of Spain: Anarchism and the Struggle for the Emancipation of WomenCowards don't make history; and the women of Mujeres Libres (Free Women) were no cowards. Courageous enough to create revolutionary change in their daily lives, Mujeres Libres mobilized over 20,000 women into an organized network to strive for community, education, and equality for women -during the Spanish Revolution. Martha Ackelsberg writes a comprehensive study of Mujeres Libres, intertwining interviews with the women themselves and analysis connecting them with modern feminist movements. Martha Ackelsberg is a professor of government and a member of the Women's Studies Program Committee at Smith College, where she teaches courses in political theory, urban politics, political activism and feminist theory. She has contributed to a variety of anthologies on women's political activism in the United States.	To the Finland StationFrom the ideas of early 19th-century socialists to the thoughts of Marx, Engels, Lenin & Trotsky, Edmund Wilson traces the development of the political & intellectual movements that culminated in the Russian Revolution. TO THE FINLAND STATION is a work of history on a grand scale, at once sweeping, detailed, closely reasoned & passionately argued, that succeeds in painting an unforgettable picture--alive with conspirators, philosophers, utopians & nihilists--of the making of the modern world. 'The 1st thing that strikes us about To the Finland Station is the vastness of its scope...It is easily, equally at home in the philosopher's study, in the prisoner's cell, on the steppes, in the streets, melancholy in great country houses, choking in fetid industrial slums...It can remind us that our history is alive & open & rich with excitement & promise'--NY Times Book Review	Demanding the Impossible: A History of AnarchismLively and authoritative, this study of a widely misunderstood subject skillfully navigates the rough waters of anarchistic concepts--from Taoism to Situationism, ranters to punk rockers, individualists to communists, and anarcho-syndicalists to anarcha-feminists. Exploring key anarchist ideas of society and the state, freedom and equality, authority and power, the record investigates the successes and failures of anarchist movements throughout the world. Presenting a balanced and critical survey, the detailed document covers not only classic anarchist thinkers--such as Godwin, Proudhon, Bakunin, Kropotkin, Reclus, and Emma Goldman--but also other libertarian figures, such as Nietzsche, Camus, Gandhi, Foucault, and Chomsky. Essential reading for anyone wishing to understand what anarchists stand for and what they have achieved, this fascinating account also includes an epilogue that examines the most recent developments, including postanarchism and anarcho-primitivism as well as the anarchist contributions to the peace, green, and global justice movements of the 21st century.	3601	6585	192	2743	2896	5709	-1	27792	11	274\$\$The Spanish Anarchists: The Heroic Years 1868-1936The seminal history of Spanish anarchism: from its earliest inception to the organizations that claimed over two million members on the eve of the 1936 Revolution. Hailed as a masterpiece, it includes a new prefatory essay by the author. "I've read The Spanish Anarchistswith the excitement of learning something new. It's solidly researched, lucidly written, and admirably fair-minded... Murray Bookchin is that rare bird today, a historian." --Dwight MacDonald "I have learned a great deal from this book. It is a rich and fascinating account... Most important, it has a wonderful spirit of revolutionary optimism that connects the Spanish anarchists with our own time." --Howard Zinn Murray Bookchin has written widely on politics, history, and ecology. His books To Remember Spain: The Anarchist And Syndicalist Revolution Of 1936, The Ecology of Freedom, Post-Scarcity-Anarchism, The Ecology of Freedom, and Social Anarchism or Lifestyle Anarchism: An Unbridgeable Chasm--are all published by AK Press.	Anarchy in ActionWith chapters on the family, federations, schools, housing, crime, employment, welfare, deviancy, planning, and more, this is probably the best practical example of anarchist ideas in action. As Colin Ward writes in his introduction, "This book is not intended for people who had spent a lifetime pondering the problems of anarchism, but for those who either had no idea of what the word implied or knew exactly what it implied and rejected it, considering that it had no relevance for the modern world... It is not about strategies for revolution and it is not involved in speculation on the way an anarchist society would function. It is about the ways in which people organize themselves in any kind of human society, whether we care to categorize those societies as primitive, traditional, capitalist or communist."	The Spanish Civil War: Reaction, Revolution, and RevengePaul Preston is the world's foremost historian of Spain. This surging history recounts the struggles of the 1936 war in which more than 3,000 Americans took up arms. Tracking the emergence of Francisco Franco's brutal (and, ultimately, extraordinarily durable) fascist dictatorship, Preston assesses the ways in which the Spanish Civil War presaged the Second World War that ensued so rapidly after it. The attempted social revolution in Spain awakened progressive hopes during the Depression, but the conflict quickly escalated into a new and horrific form of warfare. As Preston shows, the unprecedented levels of brutality were burned into the American consciousness as never before by the revolutionary war reporting of Ernest Hemingway, John Dos Passos, Herbert Matthews, Vincent Sheean, Louis Fischer, and many others. Completely revised, including previously unseen material on Franco's treatment of women in wartime prisons, The Spanish Civil Waris a classic work on this pivotal epoch in the twentieth century.	Anarcho-Syndicalism: Theory and PracticeIn 1937, at the behest of Emma Goldman, Rocker penned this political and philosophical masterpiece as an introduction to the ideals fueling the Spanish social revolution and resistance to capitalism the world over. Within, Rocker offers an introduction to anarchist ideas, a history of the international workers' movement, and an outline of the syndicalist strategies and tactics embraced at the time (direct action, sabotage and the general strike). Includes a lengthy introduction by Nicholas Walter and a Preface by Noam Chomsky. "[Rocker's] approach is far from 'utopian'; this is not an abstract discourse but a call to action."--Noam Chomsky Rudolf Rocker (1873-1958) was a leading figure in the international anarchist movement for over 60 years. In Oakland, California on March 24, 2015 a fire destroyed the AK Press warehouse along with several other businesses.

Examining animals, indigenous societies, medieval cities, and the modern era, Kropotkin demonstrates the importance of cooperation and collective enterprise to evolution and survival, and as a means to social justice. This edition includes Kropotkin's extensive notes which are at the end of each chapter.	5002	2743	3601	5725	482	24273	-1	47500	-1	274
The Breeders (Breeders, #1)"When the Breeders come for ya, there ain't no escape. They strap ya to a bed and all ya hear is the thud of your heart and the cries of your friends as they wheel ya down to hell. Then the doctors come. You squeeze your eyes shut and pray you can forget. But ya never do." Sixteen-year-old Riley Meemick is one of the world's last free girls. When Riley was born, her mother escaped the Breeders, the group of doctors using cruel experiments to bolster the dwindling human race. Her parents do everything possible to keep her from their clutches - moving from one desolate farm after another to escape the Breeders' long reach. The Breeders control everything - the local war lords, the remaining factories, the fuel. They have unchecked power in this lawless society. And they're hunting Riley. When the local Sheriff abducts the adult members of her family and hands her mother over to the Breeders, Riley and her eight-year-old brother, Ethan, hiding in a shelter, are left to starve. Then Clay arrives, the handsome gunslinger who seems determined to help to make up for past sins. The problem is Clay thinks Riley is a bender - a genderless mutation, neither male nor female. As Riley's affection for Clay grows she wonders can she trust Clay with her secret and risk her freedom? The three embark on a journey across the scarred remains of New Mexico - escaping the Riders who use human sacrifice to appease their Good Mother, various men scrambling for luck, and a deranged lone survivor of a plague.

A Voz dos Deuses<<Em 147 a.C., alguns milhares de guerrilheiros lusitanos encontram-se cercados pelas tropas do pretor Caio Vetilio. Em principio, trata-se apenas de mais um episodio da guerra que a Republica Romana trava ha longos anos para se apoderar da Peninsula Iberica. Mas os Lusitanos, acossados pelo inimigo, elegem um dos seus e entregam-lhe o comando supremo. Esse homem, que durante sete anos vai ser o pesadelo de Roma, chama-se Viriato. Entre 147 e 139, ano em que foi assassinado, Viriato derrotou sucessivos exercitos romanos, levou a revolta grande parte dos povos ibericos e foi o responsavel pelo inicio da celebre Guerra de Numancia. Viriato foi um verdadeiro genio militar, politico e diplomatico. Mas, sobretudo, Viriato foi o defensor de um mundo que morria asfixiado pelo poderio romano: o mundo em que mergulham as raizes mais profundas de Portugal e de Espanha. E esse mundo, ja entao em declinio, que este livro tenta evocar. Aquando do seu aparecimento, em 1984, Fernando Assis Pacheco escreveu serem raras as estreias com tanta qualidade. Depois disso, A Voz dos Deuses, ao longo de sucessivas edicoes, tornou-se um "classico" do romance historico portugues contemporaneo. Plano Nacional de Leitura Livro recomendado para o 3o ciclo, destinado a leitura autonoma. Tambem recomendado para a Formacao de Adultos como sugestao de leitura.

The Shadow of the ShadowThe Shadow of the Shadowfollows four men who meet to play dominos in a hotel bar in Mexico City in 1922. They are a motley group--a gun-toting poet who makes a living writing advertisements for patent medicine, a radical Chinese-Mexican union organizer, a lawyer who represents prostitutes, and a newspaper crime reporter who churns out pages of copy "like links of sausage in a chorizofactory." Left to their own devices, the group would have waited out Carranza's presidency in their own quietly besotted fashion, ignoring the betrayal of the Mexican Revolution. But they witness a series of strangely related murders and begin to suspect a conspiracy involving the oil-rich lands of the Gulf Coast, greedy army officers, and American industrialists. Critics have hailed The Shadow of the Shadowas the best of Paco Ignacio Taibo II's historical novels. Issues of oil, American imperialism, extortion, and government corruption give the novel a distinctly contemporary ring.
